 [PATIENT] We're doing everything we can,but his body is weak. [DOC] I understand. Just please,keep trying. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] His condition is terminal. [DOC] No. No,that can't be right. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We need to rule out all possibilities. [DOC] This is taking so long. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's helping him breathe,but his condition is still critical. [DOC] He has to get better. We just got married. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Yes,but she might not be able to talk much. [DOC] That's okay. I just want to be with her. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He's lost a lot of blood and we're working to stabilize him. [DOC] Is he going to be okay Tell me he's going to be okay. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] I'm afraid I have some bad news. [DOC] What is it <|endoftext|>
" [PATIENT]  ""This is not your fault. These things happen."" [DOC] But I feel so helpless. <|endoftext|>"
 [PATIENT] It's too early to say for sure,but we're hopeful. [DOC] Thats not very reassuring,doctor. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're using all available resources to fight for their recovery. [DOC] Fight That sounds ominous. What are their chances  <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We'll keep him as comfortable as possible. [DOC] Thank you for taking care of him. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're discussing treatment options,and we'll know more soon. [DOC] Treatment options But... is there any hope <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] I know this is difficult,but we're here for you. [DOC] I just want her to be okay. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's difficult to say with certainty... [DOC] Just tell me. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Your loved one is showing remarkable resilience,exceeding our expectations. [DOC] Resilience That's incredible I'm so relieved.  <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He's still in recovery,but you can see him soon. [DOC] Please,just let me see him. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Of course,let me show you the way. [DOC] Thank you so much. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We'll make sure she's as comfortable as possible. [DOC] Thank you. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're still monitoring them closely. [DOC] So they could still...? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's a rare form of cancer. We need to discuss treatment options. [DOC] Cancer? How how could this happen <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We'll continue to monitor him closely and adjust his treatment as needed. [DOC] We trust you completely. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] I understand. This is a difficult conversation. [DOC] I can't...I can't talk about this right now. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're going to try a new medication. [DOC] Will it help her wake up? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We have to discuss endoflife care options. [DOC] No,no,we're not there yet. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The biopsy results are in. [DOC] And <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] She's a fighter,but this is serious. [DOC] I know,doctor. It's just...so sudden. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Try not to worry too much just yet. [DOC] That's easier said than done. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We'll do everything we can to figure this out. [DOC] Please,just find out what's wrong. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We have a good team here,and we'll do everything we can. [DOC] I don't know what to do... <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Your brother's surgery was a success. [DOC] Thank God Is he alright <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Let's not jump to conclusions. We'll observe him and go from there. [DOC] Okay,but I'm concerned. <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] We're monitoring him closely and will keep you updated. [DOC] Thank you,Doctor. <|endoftext|>
" [PATIENT]  ""We'll keep you updated every step of the way."" [DOC] Thank you,doctor. <|endoftext|>"
 [PATIENT] It's not your fault. These things can happen unexpectedly. [DOC] But she was perfectly healthy... <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's hard to say, but we're focused on making him comfortable. [DOC] This isn't fair. He's too good of a man. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Yes,of course. Follow me. [DOC] Thank you so much I've been so worried. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Her body isn't responding to treatment as we hoped. [DOC] Is she going to be okay <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We won't know for sure until the biopsy results come back. [DOC] This can't be happening. How could this happen <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It means we need to be very careful. We have the best team on it. [DOC] I just... I don't want to lose her. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We need to talk about your father's treatment options. [DOC] What are they <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The surgery went well,but she's still in shock [DOC] Can I see her <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We'll explain everything in detail. [DOC] Will they be okay? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're still running tests to identify the specific bacteria. [DOC] But how did this happen She was perfectly healthy. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He lost more blood than we anticipated. [DOC] Is he going to be alright <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We'll be here to support you either way. [DOC] I appreciate that. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The surgery went well,but he's still in a critical condition. [DOC] I can't lose him,doctor. He's all I have left. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He'll need some time to heal,but he's expected to make a full recovery. [DOC] I can't wait to see him. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We understand this is a difficult time. We're here for you. [DOC] Thank you. We appreciate your support. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] I know it's difficult to hear,but it's the best option. [DOC] I don't know what to say. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] There's some damage, but it's not as bad as we initially feared. [DOC] So she'll be okay? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We were able to remove the tumor,but we need to run more tests. [DOC] Is it... is it cancer <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're doing our best to control the bleeding,but his condition is unstable. [DOC] Is he... is he going to die <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] I understand. We'll have the results soon. [DOC] Is there anything I can do for him right now <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's too early to say for sure,but the signs are positive. [DOC] I just want him back to his old self. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Your wife is resting comfortably now. [DOC] Thank goodness. When can I see her <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] He'll need to stay with us for a while for monitoring and rehabilitation. [DOC] We'll do whatever it takes. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We've had to put your husband on a ventilator. His breathing is labored. [DOC] A ventilator Is he going to be okay <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] You can visit him soon. [DOC] Thank you again,for everything. <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] We'll be here to support you both through this. [DOC] Thank you. We appreciate that. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] She's a strong little girl. [DOC] She is,and she gets that from her mother. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Your mother is stable, but her condition is still critical. [DOC] What does that mean exactly? Is she going to be alright? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Eventually,yes,but she may need additional care. [DOC] This is a lot to think about. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Your daughter's condition has stabilized. [DOC] Oh,thank goodness  Is she going to be okay <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He's in a coma. His condition is very serious. [DOC] Please tell me he's going to wake up. <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] It's too early to say for sure,but we're hopeful. [DOC] I don't know what I would do without her. <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] We all do,and we're doing everything in our power to make that happen. [DOC] Can I see him before the surgery <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The surgery went well,but there's a chance of nerve damage. [DOC] Will he be paralyzed <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He's taken a turn for the worse. [DOC] What do you mean He was doing better yesterday. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The tests are inconclusive. We need to do more. [DOC] More tests But why Isn't it obvious what's wrong <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He's a strong kid. [DOC] He really is. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The tests confirm it's a heart attack. He's in critical condition. [DOC] But he's so young. This can't be happening. <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] We're here for you both. We'll fight this together. [DOC] I'm so scared. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We just need to monitor her for a few more days. [DOC] We can do that. We're just happy she's getting better. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We can discuss that option,but it's a long and complex process. [DOC] I just want him to have a chance. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The biopsy results are back,and it's not what we hoped for. [DOC] What is it What's wrong <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] They're still in recovery. It will be a few hours. [DOC] Okay,I can wait. How are they doing <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] You can see him soon,but he'll be groggy from the anesthesia. [DOC] I don't care. I just need to see him. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] They're not responding to treatment as we hoped. [DOC] No... Please, you have to do something! <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're addressing them,but their condition is now more serious. [DOC] More serious I can't believe this,I'm falling apart. <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] We're all so happy for you and your family. [DOC] We're so grateful. <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] The results are inconclusive. [DOC] What does that mean? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The medication seems to be working. His blood pressure is stabilizing. [DOC] Oh, thank God... <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] We were able to resuscitate him, but his heart stopped for several minutes. We're not sure what the long-term effects will be. [DOC] Will he be okay? Will he wake up? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're going to need to start a more aggressive course of antibiotics. [DOC] Will that be enough to help her get better <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] Absolutely,let me take you to him [DOC] Thank you <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] She has multiple fractures and internal bleeding. We're doing everything we can. [DOC] But will she make it <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] I'm afraid we've exhausted all of our options. [DOC] What do you mean <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's not what we were hoping for. [DOC] What does that mean? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're taking all necessary steps to treat the infection. [DOC] I'm so worried... <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Your son is out of surgery. We were able to remove the tumor. [DOC] Oh,thank goodness Is he going to be alright <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We'll do our best,but it's important to consider his quality of life. [DOC] Quality of life Just keep him alive <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] She's had a rough day,but she's holding on. [DOC] I'll go sit with her. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Her spirit is truly inspiring. She keeps asking about you. [DOC] I'll be here as much as I can. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He's still weak,but he's definitely improving. [DOC] That's wonderful news <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're here to support you through this difficult time. [DOC] I don't know what to do. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We need to run some additional tests to get a clearer picture. [DOC] But why What's going on <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We need to discuss the possibility of surgery. [DOC] Surgery Is that really necessary <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] She's doing much better,and her recovery looks promising. [DOC] This is the best news Thank you so much. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We need to run further tests to get a clearer diagnosis. [DOC] Is it serious <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] She'll need to continue her medication and therapy,but she's doing well. [DOC] I can't wait to bring her home. <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] Their resilience has been truly inspiring to witness. [DOC] Inspiring  It's heartbreaking,but they are strong.  <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] I know,it's been a stressful time. But she's strong. [DOC] She is. Thank you for everything. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The accident caused severe head trauma [DOC] Will she...will she ever wake up <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's difficult to say, but she'll require extensive rehabilitation. [DOC] Will she ever fully recover? Will she be the same? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're doing everything we can. [DOC] I know you are. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's unlikely to be effective at this stage. [DOC] So... there's no hope <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] The surgery went well,but there were some complications. [DOC] Complications What kind of complications <|endoftext|>
" [PATIENT]  ""We'll do everything we can to help him achieve those dreams."" [DOC] I hope so. I really hope so. <|endoftext|>"

 [PATIENT] Just remember to take it easy and let them rest. [DOC] Of course,I will. Thank you again. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's hard to say exactly. Their body isn't responding as we'd hoped. [DOC] What does that mean Are they going to be okay <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Your mother's condition has taken a turn for the worse. [DOC] What do you mean? What happened? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] She had a reaction to the anesthesia. She's stable now, but we're monitoring her closely. [DOC] This is so stressful. Will she be okay? <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] I understand your concern,we're doing everything we can. [DOC] I just want to know what's happening to my sister. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We're doing everything we can. [DOC] I just want him to wake up. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He's not responding to treatment as we had hoped. [DOC] Is he going to die <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We need to talk about your mother's condition. It's... not improving. [DOC] What are you saying <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] His lungs are struggling,and he needs help breathing. [DOC] Will this help him get better <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We'll need to adjust his medication and monitor him very closely. [DOC] Is he going to be okay <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We did everything we could,but her injuries were too severe. [DOC] This can't be happening. We were supposed to grow old together... <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] We'll let you know when he wakes up. [DOC] Thank you. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's benign. There's no sign of cancer. [DOC] Oh my god,thank you Thank you so much <|endoftext|>

 [PATIENT] It's too early to say for certain, but we're cautiously optimistic. [DOC] I just want him to be okay. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] Yes,of course. Follow me. [DOC] How is he doing <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] He's been asking for you constantly. [DOC] I've been so worried. <|endoftext|>
 [PATIENT] It's difficult to say,but it could be a matter of weeks. [DOC] Weeks... But he was just fine yesterday. <|endoftext|>
