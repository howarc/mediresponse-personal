So what we'll do uh for her is get something called a pulmonary function test for her to see, that'll test if she in fact has asthma or not, and then based on that we will uh see if she needs any puffers. Um that can help relieve some of her symptoms. Uh and lastly, since she's having a cough, we'll also do a like a Covid test just in case as well.","OK, yeah that that sounds good. Thank you."

"No, that's fine.","OK, so that that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and look for on the physical today. Did you have anything else that perhaps I forgot to mention that might be important?"
"Uhm no that was kind of it, I just was wondering how we can fix her elbow.","I yeah certainly so. It will be so when I get an elbow X Ray. And. But typically to fix this type of injury, so currently I'm thinking this could be a like a radial head subluxation, and possibly a radial head fracture, but most likely I radial head subluxation, where there's a mechanism of pulling on a child's arm. And it's just that the what could happen is the part of the radius, which is that a forearm bone can pull out of the ligament that's holding it down."
OK.,"An just because of the structures there, not yet fully matured and strong, and somebody who's that young. And so it will cause pain reduced range of motion at the elbow and you won't really see much swelling or redness, and with just the physical exam maneuver you can reduce it and then put the head of the radius back into place and things will be usually back to back to normal. But if there is a fracture which will look for an X-Ray then there the pain might be last a little bit longer, but immobilization of the arm is not required and most kids will regain full mobility in in a short time after the reduction."
What brings you in here today?,"I've been having this pain in my knee and it's been going on now for a few weeks.

OK alright yeah. So those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions?,I was just wondering what I can do to make this go away.
"Yeah, so definitely this is something that is what we call Jumpers knee. It's fairly common, uh, amongst younger athletes, especially those that play sports like volleyball or basketball. But right now we don't really need to do any kind of imaging or anything like that. It seems like you're in the earlier phases and it's good that you came in. We definitely do need to manage it with some conservative management where we're going to keep having taking a look at it as well as I would recommend icing it every, like for half an hour, like around four to six times a day, especially after you're doing your activities. Then you can you can take the, continue taking the Tylenol and Advil, as well. As long as you're following the maximum amount per day depending on if you're taking extra strength Tylenol for example versus the regular strength. And then I will also refer you to some physiotherapy that will kind of a teach you some strengthening and stretching exercises that you can do to help what we call like that you will you might be having is just um some inflammation in your patellar tendon, right below your patella. So we need to strengthen the muscles around it. So we'll do some referral to physiotherapy and then we'll see how you you do based on all those treatment options and then if it gets worse and if or if it doesn't get better, we might need to do some imaging, either ultrasound or an MRI and then see where to go from there. But for now does that sound OK with you?","It does, yeah, thank you. So you said that you think it's like a patellar tendonitis or something like that?"
"Yeah, it's patellar tendonitis is commonly called the jumpers knee and it should resolve with the steps that we, especially since it seems like you're in the earlier stages. So it seems like it should be pretty responsive, but if it isn't, there are other steps we can discuss in the future.","OK, that sounds great. Thank you."
,What brings you in today?
"Hey, so I just for the last couple days I've just been feeling really short of breath really rundown. Just like super tired and you know, normally really active and I'm just, I'm just having a rough go.",Is there is the shortness of breath knew for you?

I kind of just feel I feel a bit weak like I've just been feeling really tired and then because of that I haven't really been eating a lot so. Yeah, I don't know.","So. You've just been feeling very tired, can you I guess, like tell me a little bit more about your difficulty with breathing. When does it happen?"
"I think just like overall, I'm finding it like it's hard to hard to get like super deep breaths it's not like I I can't. I don't get the feeling that I can't breathe. It's just that everything's a little bit more like laborious.",OK. And you said that it started a few days ago. Have you had any other symptoms other than the difficulty breathing and the fatigue?
"I mean. I felt I think I felt really hot yesterday. I don't know the thermometer, but I had my wife put her put her hand on my forehead and she got a I felt pretty warm. And come to think of it, I this morning I, I really I didn't eat much because I just haven't been that hungry, but I don't really feel like I couldn't really taste my breakfast.",Has that ever happened to you before?
"No never I like, I like my food.","Me too, um OK, what about your sense of smell? Do you feel like you're not you are not able to smell well either?"

Like it's when it feels dry like it's on its way. Haven't really been coughing much.,"I see, what about a sore throat?"

No.,Any headaches?
"Uh. Good question, I I kind of I get I get headaches fairly often I don't think I'm getting any more than usual, but I have had a little bit.",OK. Is the headache that you've had different in quality from the headaches that you usually get?
"I mean, I don't know, I don't know. I usually get kind of difficult stress headache, you know?",Yeah yeah.

I would just say I feel kind of overall achy.,"OK,"
Um not any one spot.,Any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?
"Uh, no.","OK. All right, have you had any exposure to anyone who could potentially be sick?"
"Well. My grandkids, uh, visited last weekend and my grandson has a cold. He goes to daycare. Yeah, so I'm not really. I'm not really sure like he's been staying home and they didn't. They didn't really know that when they came to visit.","OK, that's yeah, uhm OK. And have you traveled anywhere outside the province?"
No no.,OK alright. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
"Uhm? I'm pretty, I'm pretty healthy. I have some um like reflux that I see my doctor for. And I've had I've had some difficulties like with like urinating a little bit. Yeah, my my prostate's a little big like it's not cancer but. So just those two things that aren't that aren't there that really big deal they don't affect my life too much.",Are you taking any medications for either problem?
I take avodart.,OK.
"And for the the reflux I take a tums here and there I used to be on a medication, but it seemed like I kind of figured out the foods that were going to help, so I stopped.","Great, that's great. Any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental allergies?"
"Uh no, no","No, and any medical conditions that run in the family? Specifically, anything related to the lungs?"

"No, I I maybe did for maybe like three years in my 20s. It wasn’t heavily yes.",Any marijuana or recreational drugs?
No.,Any alcohol?
I usually have a whiskey or two on the weekends.,"OK alright. Uh so it sounds like you have some sort of an infection with the fevers and fatigue and muscle aches, and then the difficulty breathing, of course, and then your sensation, that sensation that you are having a very cool sort of a sore throat and cough that you might be getting. We can't necessarily rule out covid just yet."
Thats what I was worried about.,"Yeah, and given that you're having difficulties breathing, we're also going to have a look at your chest and do it physical exam, but also do a chest X Ray just to make sure, or just to see if there's anything a infection that is settling in your chest, and a covid swab and then uh go from there. We’ll decide whether you need to stay in the, you need to stay in the hospital and if you can go home based on those results, but if you are to go home, we would request that you stay away from from everyone, so including your wife. Try to self isolate as much as possible and your results should come out in 24 to 48 hours and then the public health nurse should tell you what to do if your results are positive."
"OK, OK no, that sounds fair,","All right. Well, let's do a physical exam and then go from there."

"You should be able to enjoy that. So, so we're going to try to get this sorted out for you.

"Okay. Alright, and those are all the questions I had for history taking. Let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview. Um, I'm just going to get you to take a look at both her elbows and arms. Do you see any, um, redness or swelling in the right elbow compared to the left?","No, I don't see that. No, I don't see any changes."
"Okay, how about um, any muscle atrophy, deformities, or skin changes, like bruises?","Um, no, I don't see anything like that."
"Okay. How about, um, when you palpate her elbows, does, is she in pain?","Um, she doesn't really let me, but if I try to, I think that does cause her some pain."
"Okay, how about when you palpate her like forearm muscles?","Um, no, not as much."
"Okay, how about her biceps and triceps?","Um, no, not really."
"No, okay. Um, alright, and those are all the questions that I kind of had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?","No, I just wanted to find out if she broke something, or like, yeah, I didn't know what was going on."
"Okay. Yeah, it seems like someone of her age and just the kind of history that you're giving me, it sounds like she has something called a radial head subluxation. Um, and that's usually caused in young children when they're like pulled or lifted by the hand or wrist while their arm is held straight, um, which can kind of pull the bone out of its socket a little bit. Um, so um, in terms of like a management plan, you can try conservative things like ice packs, um, over the counter painkillers. Um, otherwise, we can try to um, put the radius back into its normal position here, which will just take uh, like a few minutes. Um, and, and then after we reduce it back into its place, um, she should have normal function of her arm again. Um, if she's still experiencing pain, we can continue keeping it on a splint, um, but otherwise, I don't think we need any imaging for this at this um, at this time. So did you have any questions or any concerns about that?","No, I think that's, um, that's a good plan."
"Okay, great. Um, thank you.",Thank you.
How may I help you?,"I'm I'm here because my right knee is very painful. It looks kind of swollen and it's it's also a little bit warm so I'm just worried, I'm worried about it and I was wondering if you could look at it."
"Yeah, certainly, um. So where are you feeling the the pain exactly?","So it's where, so right in the middle of my knee. So just below the bone that, the big knee bone."
"OK, so like underneath the kneecap, like below that?",Yeah just just a little bit below.
"OK, so slightly below the Patella. Sounds like somewhere in the region of the tibial through tuberosity.",Right.
"OK, and when did this pain start?",It started about two weeks ago.
"OK, two weeks ago when the pain started, was there any trauma or could you remember any movement that that caused the pain?","Nothing like that, but I recently found out that I had some osteoarthritis on my left knee, so I was trying to put more pressure on my right knee one whenever I was doing like gardening work um and I think something something may have happened when I was doing that, something maybe, maybe I put too much strain on it."
"OK, I see an. Alright, like are you doing a lot of kneeling on on or during the gardening work?",I am.
"OK. Um, and. How long has the pain been going on for, has it been constant over these two weeks?","Yes, it has been."
"OK, and how would you describe the pain, is it sharp, burning, achy?","I would say mostly achy, but it can be sharp."
"OK, and do you feel the pain radiate anywhere else?","No, just it's pretty local."
"OK, have you tried anything to make the pain better?","I tried some topical like what are those like ice and fire gels. Those seem to help temporarily, but the pain comes back."
"OK. And. Have you tried, has anything made the pain worse?","I guess like when I kneel down on it, it gets painful or If I touch it or palpate it, I guess painful if I'm I'm flexing my knee too much that hurts as well. Kind of keeping it straight and not touching it makes it feel better."
"OK, and. What would you say the severity of the pain is with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt and one being the least pain?",I give it about a 6.
"OK, and have you had a pain like this in your right knee before?","No, nothing like this and I have osteoarthritis in my left knee but it feels different."

"OK. And could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like who you're living with an whereabouts?",Um I live in downtown London I live in a house with my husband and my daughter.
OK. And have you been around anybody who's been sick recently?,No.
And have you traveled anywhere recently?,No.
"OK, are you currently working right now?",I yes I am.
"OK, well then what what do you do?",I work as a full time gardener for a landscaping company.
"OK, I see. So you're spending a lot of time doing kind of like repetitive kneeling type movements to do your job?","Yes, that's right."
OK And do you smoke cigarettes?,I don't.
"Alright, and do you drink alcohol?",I'll have a glass of wine every other night.
"OK, and do you use any recreational drugs?","No, I don't."
Have you used anything like that in the in the past.,No
"like IV drugs, no, OK. And in the family or is there a history of any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions?",No.
"OK. So next I just wanted to do the physical exam portion and ask you to have a look at the knee first and let me know if the if you're having any swelling, redness or warmth to the knee compared to the other side.",Sure.
"Sorry so you are having, having swelling, warmth and redness to the right knee?",Yes.
OK and are you having pain to like palpation is there a specific spot you can press on that causes a sharp pain?,"Um so just below that kneecap area there is some swelling there and when I press down on that swollen area, it causes a bit of pain."
"OK. And are you able to fully bend, bend and straighten the knee?","I can do that, but when I bend my knee it really hurts."
OK. And are you able to walk normally or do you have a limp?,"Um I can walk normally, it just hurts."
OK. So that was a everything that I wanted to ask today on the history and and physical. Was there anything? That you maybe I forgot about you wanted to add?,"No, I don't think so."
"OK, so right now it's sounding like this could possibly be a knee Bursitis. Or Prepatellar, or sorry, infra patellar bursitis or a prepatellar bursistis which are the kind of the more common types. One thing to make sure that we rule out would be a septic Bursitis. Although you're not having any fevers or chills so that makes it a little bit less likely.",Mmmm
"But if your symptoms are getting worse and you're developing a fever, it's becoming even more painful then certainly will have to rule out infection. And as well if things are not improving, potentially a structural disease and any, such as a meniscal injury, or like a ligamental injury from all of the like kneeling and and repetitive movements. But right now I think it's mostly sounding like a knee bursitis.",OK.
"OK, and treatment for that will be activity modification as well as using things like as um NSAIDS and icing to help with um the inflammation.","OK, that sounds good, thank you."
How are you doing today?,"I'm doing OK, I just had this cough that's really started to bug me."
"OK, thanks for coming into the emergency Department today. We will really try to get this sorted out for you. How long is this cough been going on for?",Um about five days 5 days.

Oh Im sad to hear that. Have you ever had anything like this before?,"Yeah, maybe when I was younger, I don't know when I had the flu or something like that."
"OK. OK, so I'll ask you few more questions about your cough. So it started 5 days ago, has it gotten any worse or better since then?","It's been getting worse for sure. It's like going all all throughout the day, and it's been even interrupting sleep."
"Oh, geez. That's too bad. Do you find that it, does it feel really dry or are you bringing up like gunky stuff?",It it's really dry.

Do you use cannabis or any other substances?,"No, I don't use anything like that."
"OK, OK, well I think that just about covers the things that I wanted to ask you today so. Based on the symptoms you're experiencing. It sounds like it could be some kind of infective process, like maybe some kind of viral infection that we're concerned about, particularly this year. I'd really like to get a swab done on you. It's not necessarily covid, but it potentially could be. So what we're going to have to ask you to do is to self isolate you and your family for 14 days and hopefully will get the results back shortly and you'll know whether your COVID test is positive or not.",OK.
Does that sound like a good plan to you?,"Yeah, that sounds good."

What brings you here today?,"Hi, I've been having this back pain for the past month, so I'd just like something for it an and you know image it if possible just to figure out what it is."
"You've been having it for the last month, is this the first time you're having this back pain?",Yeah yes.
OK and where exactly are you having the back pain?,It's in my lower back.
"OK, and what kind of pain are you experiencing, is it like a sharp stabbing pain or is that a dull aching pain?",It's kind of dull and achy but sometimes I feel like I have little spasms in my back.
"OK, and how often are you getting these spasms?",Um I'd say like two to three times a week.
"OK. And it is this back pain constant, or does it come come and go?","It's pretty constant, but it gets worse with certain things."
"So one month ago when it started before then, did you injure yourself at all or, were you doing anything that brought on the pain or did the pain come on gradually?","So I work in this factory where I move a lot of boxes and I think I may have like lifted a really heavy box or lifted it in an improper position because that's when, that night is when my back started hurting."
"OK, I see and how long have you worked in this role?",For the past 30 years.
OK Alright. And has the pain become worse at all or has it stayed the same since it started?,I'd say it's pretty. It's been pretty similar to the start.
"OK. And does the back pain move anywhere, like for example does it shoot down your legs at all?",No OK. Have you tried anything that has helped you?
"I've tried some topical analgesics, and you know those fire and ice gels and I think sometimes that helps, but it's always temporary.","OK. And what kind of things make your pain worse like, bending down as opposed to stretching backwards?"
"Yeah, bending down like it when I flex my back that hurts more than if I straighten it out.",OK. Is a bending hurts more and what about bending towards the sides?
Um a little bit more towards my right side.,"OK. And are you having any other symptoms, like numbness or tingling in your extremities or back at all?"
No.,And any kind of numbness or loss of sensation in your buttocks area or just below your lower back?
Um no,OK. And any fevers or chills?
Nope.,Any night sweats?
No.,Any um skin changes or rashes?
No.,"Any, have you been ill recently at all with cough cold symptoms at all?"
No.,"Do you feel pain in anywhere else, in any other muscles or joints at all?"
Um no.,Have you recently had any changes to your weight?
No.,OK. And. Any kind of changes to your bowel movements?
No.,OK. Any kind of issues with urination at all?
No.,And any urinary or fecal retention or incontinence?
No.,"Right, so it's just this pain that's been there for the last month, stayed around the same. In terms of your medical history have you been diagnosed with the. Have any medical conditions in the past?"

I'm taking some time off work until I figure out what this back pain is.,"OK. And currently, what's your living situation like?"
I live in an apartment with my wife and our teenage son.,OK. And do you smoke at all?
I used to smoke. I haven't smoked in over 10 years.,OK. And do you drink alcohol at all?
"I drink occasionally, I'll have like a beer on the weekend.",Any recreational drugs like marijuana?
No.,"OK. Alright, so I'm just gonna ask a few questions, maybe get you to do some movements and see what hurts the most."
OK.,"So when you press your hand down, down your spine. Is it hurt at all in the lower back with palpation?"
"Um it kinda hurts right in the middle, uh, just above the buttocks area an where like my tailbone almost is","I see. And, uh, any kind of pain with lying down and then raising your legs straight up without bending the knees."
"I can try that. Um that hurts a little bit, yeah.",And does it hurt in the lower back or near the front of your hips?
That hurts in my lower back.,"And any kind of redness or swelling that you've noticed at all? I know it's in the back, so it might be more difficult to see."
"Um no, I don't see anything like that.","OK. And are you, has your gait, changed at all, or is it, are you able to walk without a limp or anything?"
I'm able to walk without a limp.,"OK. Alright, so and then, uh, bending down you said hurts more than standing up or extending your back, right?"
Yes.,"OK. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions for me?"
"No, just like how can I treat this?","Yeah, for sure. So this has been going on for the last month. It sounds more like what's called mechanical back pain and due to the nature of your work having been lifting heavy objects for the last 30 or so years it's usually something that occurs with repetitive, repetitive work, and strenuous work like that that affects your back. And what you're describing with the flexion seems more pain coming from the discs themselves instead of the facets at the back. So every time you flex you have some compression of your discs. So what we what we need to do right now is it's been one month almost and then usually we get imaging if the pain does not improve after six weeks of conservative management. So what we can try is to give you some pain management first, and some anti-inflammatory medication, and then as well as try some physiotherapy, some exercises to help you with the back pain. And then if the pain does not improve and since there is no red flags that were too worried about right now with your back pain we can wait to get some imaging. But first we would just like to try some of the conservative management. Is that OK with you?"
"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.","You're welcome, alright take care."
"To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brought you in today?",Really I just don't I I don't feel quite right like I've had this pain in my chest for five days now and I've been just feeling kind of out of breath.
"Oh OK, um where are you feeling this pain?","Um, it's it's kind of um. On the left side of my chest and it's just like a tiny. It's like a lingering sharp pain. I don't really feel it anywhere else. It's just kind of there all the time right now. I I've never had anything like this before."
"OK, so you're not feeling the pain radiate any to any other locations. You're just feeling it sort of in the one spot on the left side?","Yeah, yeah, exactly."
"OK, and since this pain started 5 days ago, has it gotten any better, any worse, or stayed the same?","Like when I when it started I was just I was just like sitting on my couch. Um and now it's harder if I'm, it's worse if I'm walking around, like if I walk just down the street to get the mail. But otherwise it's kind of kind of just there, like I took some Tylenol and Advil, and they maybe take the edge off a little bit, but it's always there. And it's worse when I, when I take a deep breath then I really feel it."
"OK, so it's worse. Is the pain worse when you're walking as well? Like out to get the mail?","It's I don't the the pain is, but I I'm not I can't catch my breath when I'm doing that."
"OK, and how far could you usually walk, or um?","Oh yeah, usually walk before I go for long walks like every day, like probably like 5 kilometers or something."
"OK, so prior to this happening you were feeling well?","Yeah, totally. I've not ever had any problems with my heart or lungs or anything. I thought it was maybe just like a chest infection. But I I don't know anymore."

"OK, how about any nausea or vomiting?",No.
"OK, and um, how is your energy been? Have you experienced any like significant fatigue?","Um. Not. Well, I mean, I've been doing less stuff because it's harder to breathe like I'm getting kind of like I can't catch my breath. So I guess maybe maybe a little bit like fatigue."

"OK, uh and, have you been having any night sweats?","Uh, no, no I haven't."

"OK, have you had a cough?","No, no, that's the thing, that it seems weird, right?"
"OK, um sometimes things can be associated with a cough so we'll absolutely look into what the causes of your symptoms are today. But you haven't brought up any any blood or any sputum?",No no.
"OK, and have you had any wheezing with your with your breath?",I don't know. I don't think so.

So after that it was, you know, feeling a little. Like I was kind of not drinking as much and that so I wasn't peeing as much then, but I think it's normal now."
OK um. And how have you recovered since the hysterectomy? Were you like bedbound for quite awhile afterwards or were you up an active?,"Really, it was not really long that I may be a few days, I wasn't. I wasn't walking as much, but I thought it was like back to my normal self."
"OK, well that's good. I'm glad that you recovered from that surgery quickly. And what was the surgery for?","Uh, I uh. I mean I, I'm done having kids and I, uh, I had. I was just having really heavy periods still so, uh, and you know a lot of pain there, so hat's why I had hysterectomy."
"OK, um, and have you had any bowel problems?",No no.
"OK, how about any skin changes or or rashes?",No.
"OK, how about any joint pains or or leg pains or muscle pains?","Uh, no, I don't think so."
"OK. Um, so in regards to past health, any previous medical diagnosis?","Uh, no. Just like I had the hysterectomy but I I don't like take any medications I don't have like high blood pressure or anything."
OK so no prescription medications or over the counter medications you take regularly like supplements or?,"No, just just to those like the Advil and the Tylenol I was taking for the pain."
OK. And any other surgeries besides the hysterectomy?,"Uh, like I have my wisdom teeth out when I was like a teenager. That's it though."

"OK, and have you been any been on any like long trips recently?",No I wish.
"Fair enough, vacation would be great. Um, OK so. But that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on on history, were going to run some investigations. I am concerned that you might have a pulmonary embolism, and so we're going to do some lab work and imaging to investigate that.",OK I yeah. Is that scary? Is that bad?
"It can vary from being mild to severe, and so that's what we want to get. Some of the imaging and lab work to see well to first confirm if that's what you actually have, and if so, offer the right treatment.",OK thanks doctor.

"OK, um, have you ever had anything like this before?","I do have a, uh, cough regularly, but I mean, I, I think that's related to maybe smoking. It's something that was going on for a few years. This coughs a little bit different."

OK. Is the pain primarily there when you cough or is it present at all times?,"I would say more so when I cough or if I'm like taking a big breath. Um yeah, kind of after after I have a coughing episode I take a deep breath and I really will feel the pain then."
"OK, and and um, you said that it's a sharp pain?","Yeah, yeah, more of a sharp pain."
"OK, OK, and is it any worse when you're doing activity, like when you're up and walking around?","No, don't notice it with any any activity."
"OK. OK, um an since uh, since this coughing and this this right sided pain that you're talking about began, have you noticed any fevers?","I think, yeah, I've been hot the last few days and I I checked my temperature earlier today and it was like 38.6 so that was one of the reasons why I wanted to come in actually."
"OK. OK, well I'm glad that I'm really glad that you came in because yeah, we really want to get this looked into. Have you been around anyone that's been sick recently?","No, but I I do some volunteer work at one of the homeless shelters at a few times a week, so I am around a lot of people."
OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?,"No, I've been at home. And and doing the volunteer work."
"OK um. OK, and can you just give me an idea of any? Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly or anything you take medication for?","Um yeah, I have type 2 diabetes. And I I take Metformin. Um I think an SGLT 2 inhibitor and then I use insulin for that as well. And I have some, it has affected my kidneys as well. The diabetes I mean."
"OK, do you have a history of high blood pressure?",I do yes.
"OK, do you take medication for that?","Oh yeah, I do. It starts with an ""a"" I think, amlodipine."
OK OK and do you have any history of heart problems?,"No, not that I know. No, I haven't really had any chest pain. On the left side anyway."
"Um, So you said that you have had a cough for a really long time, a dryer cough then you're having sputum now. But is that something you've seen the doctor for?","Oh yeah, I think I was called like bronchitis in the past or something. Something like that. One of the doctors, my family doctor told me it was because I was a smoker."
"OK. So just to make sure I have your list of medications, you take amlodipine, insulin",
What brings you in here today?,"So my back has been killing me it's been hurting for the past two months, but recently it's gotten worse. I'd say over the past week or two weeks it's gotten really bad and no over the counter medication is helping with the pain. It's I'm finding it hard to walk. I can't feel anything in the groin area and I'm having so many bladder accidents."
"OK, and so this pain started two months ago, but it's progressed to like these other symptoms as well?","Yes, that's right."

"OK and did anything happened prior to the pain, any injuries at all that you experienced?","Two months ago I was in a motor vehicle accident um an I think my back started hurting then but they did some imaging it's and turned out like one of the discs there was a slip in a disc or something, but at that point the pain was just achey and I don't really have any in any of these other issues. But over the past two weeks it's gotten sharp and I'm having all these other symptoms."
"OK, um and. So you're having the set like what's called, some numbness in your groin. Is that unilateral, like on one side or both sides?","Uhm, it seems like it's both sides."

"Eight or nine OK, and does it get worse with any, any motions at all?","I think it's worse with um, I don't know like, it's worse with anything, anytime, anytime I tried to move it, it hurts."
"OK, so you just improved with rest complete rest.",Yeah.
"OK. Does it travel in, does the pain travel anywhere else, does it shoot down your legs at all?","Yeah, so it does shoot down my legs and I'm having a hard time walking because of that."
Is it both legs or just one?,"It's mostly on my right, but the left one isn't the same as it used to be either."
OK,"Yeah, I'm having a hard time like getting up from a chair and things like that."
"OK, and anything that you've tried that has helped relieve some of your symptoms.",I've tried like over the counter counter and ibuprofen. I've tried some topical analgesics and nothing seems to be working.
OK. And. Have you experienced any trauma? So you mentioned you had a car accident rate two months ago?,"Yes, that was. Yeah, that was two months ago."
"OK and then. Were you in the hospital, admitted to the hospital for for a while, or how, what happened in your treatment?","Yeah, I was. I was taken to the ER. They did like a full work up on me. The only thing on my back that they found was a slipped disc and then they said that should that shouldn't cause me too much pain. But if I was having any of these symptoms that I'm having now I should go back, or see a doctor at least. And and otherwise I was fine like I didn't lose a lot of blood or I didn't need any surgical interventions at that point."
"OK, I see. And have you been having any other symptoms or any any pain in any other joints or muscles?","Uhm, No, no, nothing like that."
"OK, any fevers or chills.",No.
Any night sweats?,No rashes or skin changes.
No.,"Any kind of chest pain short of, ah sorry shortness of breath?"
Um no.,Any cough or cold like symptoms?
No.,"Uhm, any so you have some urinary incontinence, any fecal incontinence?"
No.,"OK, how's an any recent changes in your weight?"
No.,Have you been sick at all recently?
No.,"OK, any tingling sensation either in your back or shooting down your legs?"
No.,Any burning sensation?
Little bit of burning sensation.,Yeah OK do you have any numbness in your lower limbs or just numbness around the groin?
Just numbness around the groin area but my lower limbs do seem weak.,OK so you have muscle weakness. Is it just one like that's ah weak or both legs?
So both like seem weak but the right more than the left.,"OK, I see. Uhm, and does this weakness seem to get worse, or is it around the same as it was when it started?"
It's it's it feels like it's getting worse.,"OK, do you have any past medical conditions you have been diagnosed with?"
"I had hypothyroid, so I've been taking Synthroid for that.","OK, any other medications?"
No.,"OK, any allergies to any medications?"
No.,OK. Any hospitalizations or previous surgeries?
No.,Any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatologic conditions?
Um no.,"OK. Currently, do you work?"
"I do. I work from home right now, I'm a teacher.","OK, uh. And do you, did you do any work previously that required heavy lifting or strenuous activities regarding your back at all."
"Um no no, nothing like that.",And what's your home and living situation like right now?
I live at home with two of my children.,"OK. And are you able to do things at home that you were before look like, or do you need some extra help from it, your family members, or extra help from other workers. Anything like that?"
"Yeah, my family's definitely been helping me out a lot over these past few weeks because. Yeah, like I said, like I'm having some weakness in my legs. I can't move around as much because I'm in so much pain. Um and then like there are all these like bladder accidents so. Yeah, they've been helping me out with everyday things.","OK, I see. And currently, do you smoke?"
No.,"OK, do you drink alcohol?"
No.,And any recreational drugs like marijuana?
No.,OK. I'm just getting at you to do a few things on just just as part of the physical examination.
Sure.,"Are you able to bend down or extend your back at all, or is it too painful?"
"Yeah, I can't do that. It's too painful.","Do you notice any kind of redness, swelling in and around your back?"
Um not that I can tell.,"OK, and how about if you press down on the your lower back, does it hurt?"
"Yeah, that hurts.",OK. And are you experiencing the numbness right now and in your groin area?
I am.,"Are you able to raise your legs when in a lying position with straight legs, knees not bending at all, they are able to raise without any pain?"
"No, I can't do that. It's yeah, it's too painful.","I see, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you so it seems. It's great, it's good that you came to the emergency Department. Do you have any questions at all?"
"No, just like how can I fix this?","Yeah, so based on your symptoms, it's something that's pretty urgent. It's seems like you may be having something called cauda Equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that's why you're feeling that groin would be called saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence. So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be. We may be worried about just to make sure. Well, just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms. And then based on what we find, uh, we will, we will target like the cause of the symptoms, like for example if it's an infect infection that's causing this, you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics. If there is any masses causing it, you may require surgery. For example if it's mainly related to your back it is something that we will have to treat with with an admission so it's good that you came in here today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"
"No, that was it. Thank you so much for your help.",You're welcome and will get back to you shortly.
How can I help you?,"Hi, I just was brought in here today. I had a fall just waking up coming down the stairs. I fell off the last few stairs and just fell onto the right side and on, right onto my head and now, uh I couldn't even I could barely stand up and put any weight on my hip. It's the right hip."
"OK, Uhm, so what caused you to fall in the 1st place? Did you just lose balance, were you dizzy?","I think I just I missed, I wasn't dizzy or anything. I just missed one of the steps and just slipped, slipped down the stairs."
OK.,But it was just the last few stairs I didn't have like I didn't hit my head or anything like that.
"OK, and when was this?",This was a so I guess now two hours ago.
"Two hours ago, OK. Has a pain been constant since?","Yeah, it's, it's really excruciating."
"OK, does anything make it better or worse?","No, it's I'm just in extreme pain. Like I I I can't even put any weight on it."
"OK, so you can't, OK so you can't weight bear, and you can't walk on on that leg I guess.",Mhmm.
OK. Is it a sharp kind of pain or is it dull and achy?,"It's uh, it's pretty sharp, like if I'm not putting any weight on it right now, it's like really achy. But if I put any weight on, it's really sharp."
OK. And where is this pain exactly? Is it just in your right hip or is it radiating up into your upper anterior lower back or down to your leg?,"It's in the right hip, mostly just on the side, but the pain is kind of like, all over the right side of my groin and I feel like there's some swelling there as well."
"OK. And one to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever. How bad is your pain?","I would say 10, like I've never experienced pain like this."

"OK, any numbness or tingling?","Uhm, no, not that I can tell, no."
Dizziness or fainting spells?,"Uhm, after the fall out like this, I I don't know if it's due to the pain, but even in the ambulance, coming out of the ambulance I was feeling a little bit dizzy, but I don't know if that's just 'cause of the pain."

"OK, and how about changes your bowel movements?",Nope.
"OK, how about changes to urine?","No, nothing."
OK. And. Are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions?,"Yeah, so I just have a, uhm I do have some osteoarthritis and then I have, I take this medication for blood pressure. It's called uh, Ramipril."
"OK. OK, and is that the only medication that you're on?","Uh, yeah. And then I'm just on vitamins like vitamin D, calcium and just multivitamins."
OK. And are you up to date with your immunizations?,Yes.
"Yeah, OK. Any allergies?","Uh, no, not that I know of."

OK. Uhm and do you smoke?,"No, I've never smoked?"
"OK, uhm, do you drink alcohol?","Just maybe like a wine, what every other day, a glass of of wine."
"OK, and then do you consume marijuana in any form?",No.
OK. And how about in terms of where you live? Who do you live with and where do you live?,"I live with uhm, just my husband and and we just live in a small apartment."
"OK. And have you been in touch with any, anyone sick recently?","Uh. No, I've I've been like at home with my husband. We haven't really left."
OK. And have you done any travel recently?,"Uhm, no, I've just stayed at home."
"OK. Alright, so let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview. So if you can, I'm going to get you to take a look at both your hips as well as your legs. Do you notice any redness or swelling in the area?",I do notice some swelling. It's a little bit red. I can't really see too much red.
OK. OK. Any muscle atrophy? Any deformities or skin changes like bruises?,"Uh, maybe some bruising, but I, I don't notice anything else."
"OK. Alright. And then when you place the back of your hand on both hips, do you notice any temperature changes? Is one side warmer than the other?","It's a little bit warmer, the right side than the left."
"OK, and does one like appear to be shorter? Or does does it appear to be misaligned? Or in any sort of like strange positions like outward turning of your leg, one compared to the other?","I think it's a bit, but look at it a bit, like outward turning. And then yeah, I would say it's more outward turns."
"OK, and if are you sitting down right now?","Uh, yeah."
"OK, are you able to stand up from a sitting position?","I can try, but it's very painful."
OK.,"Yes, should I go ahead and try?"
Yes please.,"Yeah. So I yeah I can barely stand up. I can't, it's kind of just, I'm just supporting myself with my left like."
"OK and so I, I guess you can't do any of the like hip flexion or hip extension, hip abduction or addduction, correct?","No, I can barely move it."
OK alright those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions of your own?,"No, I think I I just don't know if I need surgery or something."
"Yeah, so it sounds like you have a hip fracture from your fall. Uhm, so, the way to treat this is a combination of surgeries and rehab and medication. So we will definitely look into the surgical option first, which is done using some internal repair with screws. Or, you can do a total hip replacement or a partial hip replacement. The orthopaedic surgeon will uh, decide like which option is best for you after we refer you for a consult with them, and then after that surgery they'll likely refer you to some rehab, so physiotherapy will focus on improving your range of motion and strengthening the muscles in that area. Uhm, and for management of pain, you can take ibuprofen or any over the counter pain medications for now. Does that sound OK?","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much."
What brings you in?,"I've just been having uh, this pain in my um right, right elbow, and it's just been getting worse over the last few days. I started having it around three days ago. Um, and it's just been getting worse with any kind of gripping motion or, yeah, so it's, it's been getting worse."
"Okay, so you said it started three days ago. Um, has it been persistent since, or has it been like on and off?","It's been pretty persistent, um, but it's mainly when I'm uh, doing some activities or lifting anything. Um, and yes, I've just been trying to rest it mostly."
"Okay, okay, that's good. And um, you said it's worse with activity and better with rest. Have you tried anything else for it?","Um, I've tried some Advil, it, it seemed to help a little bit, but uh, it just comes back."
"Okay, um, and if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say it's sharp, burning, throbbing, achy?","It's more um, like if I don't extend my wrist, it's kind of like achy, but then if I extend my wrist, I feel like a sharp pain at um, on the um, just on the outside of my elbow."
"Okay, alright. Um alright, and then um, in terms of severity, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how bad is the pain?","Um, probably like a 6 or 7."
"Okay. Alright, um, and have you ever experienced this type of pain before?","No, I, I, I've never experienced any kind of pain there at least."
"Okay. Um, how about um, in terms of like timeline, is it getting worse?","Um, just over the past three days, I feel like it's, I have tried not to use it that much. Uh, like when I was at work, I have to use like tools a lot um, and I noticed that when I was using a screwdriver, like it, it hurt a lot. So it hasn't been getting worse, but if I try to do anything at work, it definitely hurts a lot more."
"Okay, um, alright. And then have you noticed any numbness or tingling?","Um, no, no, nothing like that."
"No, okay. How about um, pain elsewhere on your body?","Sorry, what was that?"
Pain elsewhere on your body?,"Oh no, no pain elsewhere."

Nausea or vomiting?,No.
Changes in your voiding?,No.
"Okay, and are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions?","Yeah no, I've been healthy, uh, no other issues in my Life."
"Okay, that's good. Um, how about, um, medications, are you on any?","No, no medications. I've just been taking some Advil for this pain."
"Okay, I see. And how about immunizations? Are you up-to-date?",Yeah.
Do you have any allergies?,"Uh, no."
Family history of any musculoskeletal issues?,"No, just uh, I guess my dad, he's, he's getting some knee pain and hip pain now, starting now. But like that's about it."
How old is he?,"My dad, he's 60."
"Okay, and any lung or heart conditions?",No.
Autoimmmune condition?,"Uh, not that I know of."
"Okay, and how about cancers?","Um, I think my aunt on my mother's side, um, she, she had, uh, uterine cancer."

"Okay. Um, any concerns for STIs?",No.
Any sick contacts recently?,No.
Have you traveled anywhere recently?,No.
"Okay, well um, let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview then. Um, so I'm going to get you to look at both your uh, arms and hands and you let me know if you see any redness or swelling in uh, your right arm compared to your left.","Okay. Um, so like, with movement?"
"Uh no, uh, just on inspection, do you see any redness or swelling?","Um, no, I don't really see anything that's too different, no."
"No, okay. Uh, do you see any deformities, atrophy, or skin changes in your right compared to your left arm or hand?","No, they look pretty similar to me."
"Okay. Alright, and then I'm gonna get you to press down on certain areas of your right arm. So you can start with the back of your elbow. Does that hurt?","Uh, just like right on the elbow, it doesn't hurt, but when I go on the outside part, it does hurt on the back."
"Okay, so like the lateral aspect of your elbow?","Yeah, it's like sore if I press down."
"Okay, how about the medial aspect of your elbow?","Um, so yeah, on the inside, not so much. Maybe a little bit, not, not that much."
"Okay, how about when you press down on your biceps or triceps?","Uh, nothing."
"Nothing. How about when you um, press down on your like, forearm extensor muscle group?","Um, just, yeah, so just on the outside of my forearm, close to where the elbow pain is, if I go down a little bit and press down, it does definitely feel sore."
"Okay, and then how about with your forearm uh, flexor, flexors.","So on the inside, um, not so much, no."
"No, okay. And now I'm gonna get you to walk through some movements with me. Um, can you uh, get a piece of paper and, actually can you get a pencil and grip it as tight as you can. Um, do you find that you feel weak when you do that?","Um, not weak, but it does definitely like um, when I picked up the pencil and moved my wrist up, it did, it did uh, cause some, some pain."
"Okay, alright. So would you mind extending or like straightening out your elbow all the way and then also straightening out your wrists. Um, does that hurt?","Uh, straightening out, no, it doesn't hurt."
"Even with uh, like the wrist um, straightened out?","Um, yeah if I, if I completely straighten out my wrist uh, then like I just feel a bit of uh, soreness, but not as much pain as when I, um, am lifting something with my wrist or just raising my wrist upwards."
"Okay. Okay, how about when you flex your wrist all the way?","Um, that hurts a little bit, but not nearly as much as when I extend it."
"Okay. Okay, um, those are all the questions I had for you today, and did you have any questions of your own for myself?","Uh, yeah, I was just wondering what this, this might be."
"Yeah, so um, it sounds like you have something called tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis. Um, and it's usually related to some overuse, um, injury, so whether at work, or if you play a lot of tennis or some sort of sport, that um, overuses a certain muscle group, um, particularly like the forearm extensors. Um, and so basically for this, um, we suggest a few things. We'll start with like some conservative management, like activity modification. So at work, if you're doing repetitive movements, maybe not do them so much and take frequent breaks, you can try some like ibuprofen, we'll refer you to some um, physiotherapy to help build those muscles around that, that area. And if those still do, don't work, um, we can try some um, other things like operative um, operative management, but we'll, we'll come back to that in about 6 to 12 months, um, once we uh, we try all of the other stuff. Does that sound okay?","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
"Hi there, I was just hoping to ask you a few questions today but I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in today.",I am just calling about my daughter. She's been sick over the last few days. She has fever and a cough.
"I see, OK. When did the fever and cough start?",So they started around three to four days ago. And around the same time she was also having like a runny nose.
"OK, and has the fever and cough been present the whole time?","Uh, yeah I would say they started around the same time and ah, they have been going on for the last three and a half to four days."
"OK, so has there been a period when she hasn't had a fever or a cough?","Uh no, every time I've measured it, she has had a fever and she's been coughing for the last few days. Hasn't really changed."
"OK, can you think of anything leading up to these symptoms?","Uh, no, she was she was fine, just three to four days ago. Like before that she was her playful self. No issues. But yeah, it's for the last couple of days just this nonstop cough and the fevers is what's really worrying me."
"OK, uh, have the symptoms have gotten worse or stayed the same?","I would say the fever has been getting a little bit worse over the last like, especially today, but the cough, coughing is about the same as what it was when it first started three days ago."
OK. Has she been sick like this before?,"She's, she often gets sick, like her brother goes to daycare and he brings a lot of bugs from there and every time he gets sick, she also gets sick. The last time she had like a similar cough was"
"think yeah, she's been having diarrhea for the last two days.","OK, uh you mentioned liquid appearing stool, what would you say say, so I guess, could you comment on the consistency and colour?"
"Consistency, I'd say it's pretty watery, like diarrhea and colour I didn't really think there's any changes in in the colour.",OK. So you didn't think there was any blood in the stool?
"No, no, no, I didn't see any blood.","OK, as for the fever, what was the maximum temperature that you noted and how did you check it?"
"So I used, we have just a regular non digital thermometer in her ear and her temperature today was around 103 degrees Fahrenheit.","OK. Uh, did you notice any tugging or pulling at her ear?"
"No, no, she doesn't seem to have any irritation there.","OK, uh, how about any vomiting or regurgitation?"
"No, she's been keeping food down. No issues there.","OK, and notice any discharge from either eye?"
"Uh, no.",How about any discharge from ears?
"Not that I've noticed, no.",Notice any rashes?
"Uh, no, I didn't not know like new rashes, no.",OK and how is she been in terms of mood or or behaviour?
"Oh she's been pretty like she's not herself over the last few days. She's been crying a lot more, just very irritable.","OK, would you say inconsolable at times?"
"Sometimes like yesterday like she, I couldn't get her to stop crying.","OK and uh, I know you said no vomiting, but has she been coughing up any sputum?"
"Yeah, I would say, uh, this green slimy content. Yeah, it's like green and slimy.","OK, um, how much would you say, uhm, like a cup, or more?"
"I would say probably like at least, at least a couple spoonfuls at a time, she would cough up.","OK, and did you notice any blood in it?"
"No, I didn't notice any blood at all.","OK, and with the cough, have you noticed any difficulties breathing?"
"Uh, I don't know if it's difficulty breathing, but I have noticed sometimes she's like breathing faster than normal, like taking a lot more breaths.","I see, OK. Uh, is she having troubles with drooling or your trouble speaking?"
"Uh, no. I haven't noticed that.","OK, and does her voice sound normal to you?"
"Yeah, I think her note, her voice hasn't really changed that much.","OK, um, with the noticing the faster rate of breathing is the breathing noisy at all?"
"Uh, no, like she's not wheezing or anything.","OK, and do you notice any like retraction of the skin between her ribs when breathing."
"Uh so like, uhm, like what do you mean by that?",Like just so when she's breathing in and out. Is she generating a lot of force and effort to really kind of suck in and blow out so you can kind of see impressions over the ribs.
"Uh no, I I don't think I've noticed that, no.","OK. And, and, have you noticed any blueish discolouration around her lips or mouth?"
"Uh, no.","OK, and any urinary problems?"
"Uh, no, she's peeing fine.",OK. And how has she been sleeping the last few days?

"Yeah, certainly, uh, so it could possibly be something related to the heart. I don't, and sometimes especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific. And so we will, we will check that for sure. We'll get an ECG and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest X Ray so that we can investigate for that. And also the chest X Ray could help us look to see if you have something going on in your lungs, like a possible pneumonia or, maybe a viral infection as well, which could include something like COVID-19. So we'll be ordering a PCR nasal swab as well to test for that. And so in the meantime, because we'll be doing that test, it requires self quarantine for 14 days so, if possible, that would mean distancing from your husband in the home as well for that 14 day period, but the results should come back from that test within the next several days. And and sorry, also if it is positive, we will have to notify public health as well so that the appropriate contact tracing can be done.","Ok, ok well thank you very much."

"OK. And then you mentioned some nasal obstruction, some discharge and you said no loss of smell, right?","No, I didn't lose any smell. Like sometimes it's kind of hard to smell because it's so plugged up."
Right.,"I still have like I'm able to smell like, especially after I do the rinses. It helps a little bit."
"OK, how about like a chest pain?","Uhm, no, I haven't had any chest pain."
"No, OK. Any issues with bowel movements or have those been normal?",Those have been normal.
OK. Any changes in your urine?,No.

"OK. OK, uhm, and are you on any medications?","No, like I I sometimes like I used this saline rinse."
OK.,"For a bit. I used to use the nasal steroid spray and I I hadn't had an infection for awhile and things were feeling OK, so I haven't been using it recently. Umm, and then I occasionally will use like, like an Advil if my knees sore."

"OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?","I don't think so. I just I hope you know, we can do something about this. Because you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. It's been like few weeks. So, I thought it was probably time to come see you."
"Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?","So I use the, the rinses the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestant but I know like I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty well it 'cause they said there's not much we can really do."
"OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?","Yeah, I think that sounds that sounds fair. Yeah, thank you."
"Um, what brings you in today?","Hi, I just came in uh, I just had this sudden, just this morning after I woke up, this sudden shortness of breath and like each time I take a deep breath I'm getting this chest pain."

"Um, do you take any medications?","I, I take this medication called um, lisinopril."
And any new medications that were started after your hospital stay?,"Um, no, they gave me like some pain medications I seem to, uh, um I got hydromorphone medication. I've been trying to stay away from it though, just taking Tylenol instead."
Is your pain controlled well with Tylenol?,"Yeah, I tried to suck it up. I just don't wanna go on those other medications. I've heard like, you can get addicted to them."
"Yeah, that's fair, that's a fair point. But it's also, I guess it's important that you move around at home. Um, so maybe try to, maybe we can increase your Tylenol dose, or maybe um, see if there's another pain med that you can be started on if you're not interested in opioids, just to make sure that you're moving around 'cause that's very important. At the hospital, did you receive an injection in your, in your tummy.","An injection in my tummy, um."

Do you drink alcohol?,"Um, yeah, probably uh, a glass, once or twice um, every couple days."
"Um, and sorry. just going back, how much did you smoke in your 20s and 30s and for how many years?","Probably smoked for, probably, 15, 15 years, probably like, like half a pack a day."
"Alright um, and do you consume any marijuana or any recreational drugs?",No.
"Okay, alright. Well given your symptoms, um, with the, with the swelling and the pain in the right calf and the difficulties breathing, it's very likely that you have um, and your recent hospitalization and hip injury, um it sounds like you might have something called, or pulmonary embolism, basically, which is a blood clot inside your lungs, and so we'll do a scan of your lungs to see what's going on. We'll also do an ultrasound of your leg, and then um, we might have to treat, uh, this with blood thinners. And we definitely have to hospitalize you, and we'll be measuring your vitals and seeing if you need any oxygen to help you out.","Okay, I'll be, I'll be here for a while then?"
"Well, we'll keep you for a bit, at least the next couple of days until your, your breathing gets better. And you've, you've been started on anti, on blood thinners.",Okay.
"And we can be sure that you're, you're doing okay, we'll also continuously monitor your vital signs um, to make sure that you're doing well, and then we'll make sure that you're discharged. We will also get you some physiotherapy here while in the hospital to help you um, mobilize better when you get home. Um, and we'll also do a COVID swab just in case. Did you have any exposures to anyone in the past couple of days before you came, at home, after you came home?","No, I've been just at home, just the nurse."

"Uhm, so it's it sounds like the most likely diagnosis now is something called Croup or laryngeal tracheal bronchitis, which is basically a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract areas, and so it can cause had a barky cough and stridor and fever. And so, if so, it's really supportive care and unless he decompensate's and becomes really short of breath and worse, in which case we could, the treatment would be steroids and uhm, possibly utilizing other other things as well, depending on his symptoms, but usually it will be steroids and maybe some oxygen as well. But if he stays relatively stable, then it's mostly supportive care, just making sure he's hydrated as much as possible, you could use like humidified air. Sometimes like a hot shower. That sort of thing can maybe help relieve the cough at night.",OK.

And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever. He's coughing and he has a runny nose and has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral and viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care, so making sure he's hydrated, eating foods with a lot of nutrition and just keep an eye on his symptoms.

"OK, and are you noticing any muscle atrophy or or any deformity at the wrist?","Uh, I guess there's like a slight bruise."
"OK, and are there any like raised bumps if you put your finger over it over the bony edges?",Uhm no bumps but just a general kind of swelling in the area that makes it look raised.
"Alright, and and if you palpate or press on some areas of the wrist are there any areas that you're feeling pain like at the distal radial head, the distal ulna, uh or any areas of the wrist?",Uhm there's some pain at the distal radius for sure.
"OK, uh, alright and is this on the back of the hand or the that the palm side.",It's on the palm side.

"OK, so I think that was everything that I wanted to check today. Did you have any questions or concerns?","Uhm no, just do I need any sort of surgery for this, and do I need an X Ray? How do I go about trying to treat this?"
"Yeah, so I think I it, X-Ray would be the first step here because from what you're describing, and particularly with the mechanism of the injury and where you're feeling pain can be a common cause of a distal radial radial fracture which is one of the forearm bones. And so yeah, we will need an X-Ray to look to see if there is a distal radial fracture. And it's not sounding like this right now, but another thing that will look for on on the X Ray of the hands too is a scaphoid fracture to make sure that that's OK, but you didn't have any pain in the area of the scaphoid, which is reassuring, but we still want to image and make sure, although that most likely thing would be the distal radial fracture an if that's the case, then there will be like we will have to go into a cast for a period of time. And depending on how much joint involvement there is, there might be the possibility of surgery, but cannot comment too much on on that just yet. We will need to get the imaging first.","OK, OK, that sounds good. Thank you."
What can I do for you?,"Hi there, yeah I've had this pain in my knee that's been going on for a few weeks now and it hasn't gone away and and so I thought I would get checked out. It's been really impacting my running. I just haven't been able to run as often as I would like to and so that's why I wanted to get this looked at."
"Yeah, for sure. You said it started a couple of weeks ago. Was that two weeks ago, three weeks ago? Or more than that?","Yeah, I would say maybe it's been going on for the past four weeks, for the past month."
Past month. OK. And is it a constant type of pain or does it come and go?,"It comes and goes, yeah, and it depends on what I'm doing."
"OK. Uhm, alright and what kind of makes it worse or better?","So if I'm out while running, what will bug it, but I think like that the main things that hurt are if I'm walking down stairs or if if I'm squatting. I like to lift weights as well, and yeah, I could barely even do body weight now 'cause if I I'm squatting down it causes a lot of pain, it's a sharp pain."

"No pain there, and then how about on the lateral aspects of your knee?","Ah, no pain there."
And then the medial aspects of your knee?,No pain there.
"No pain there. OK, good. When you are palpating, was there a difference in temperature between the left and right knee? Was the left knee a little bit more warm than the right knee?","No, the temperature feels the same."
"OK, OK, good. So now I'm going to uhm, are you sitting down?",I am yes.
"OK, so from a sitting position I'm going to get you to stand up uhm, and you let me know if that is painful.","It is, yeah."
"Yeah, OK. Uhm, and then how about when you bend your knees?","Uhm, no, no pain with just bending."
"OK, how about when you, uh, when you flex your hips so you can do one leg at a time, does that hurt?","Oh no, that doesn't hurt."

"OK, alright and yeah, you mentioned that you do a lot of running. Do you do any other sorts of exercises?","Yeah, I'll do some weight lifting and like cycling as well. I mean, all kinds of different stuff. We just, like staying as active as I can."
"OK, alright yeah, given your young age and the fact that you do a lot of running and a lot of physical activity like cycling and lifting weights, what you have is most likely something called a Patellofemoral syndrome and that is basically a nerve. Uh kind of pain and then in the in the soft tissues and bone around your kneecap. Uhm, and it's basically happens because of overuse, so vigorous physical activities that put repeated stress on your knees, like running and cycling, uhm, can cause that or just like improper sports training techniques. Uhm, we can do a few things that that'll help with the pain. So for a little bit, if you could hold off on the running that would be good. So, in the meantime, while you while you switch to like low impact activities, whether that's like riding a stationary bike or swimming, you can also try something called the RICE method and so that stands for resting, uhm, so avoiding putting any strain on that knee using ice packs for several days, compression, so wrapping your knee in like an elastic bandage, as well as elevating your knees higher than your, then the level of your chest can help. And then with the sharp pain you could also also take ibuprofen for pain management. Uhm, yeah, so we can start there if it doesn't get better we can also order an x-ray just to rule out other things that could have caused this pain in your knee. And if none of those nonsurgical treatments work, oh sorry, I also forgot to mention will also refer you to physiotherapy to help you with the range of motion and strength and endurance. But of those non surgical treatments work we'll also refer you to like am arthroscopy or some sort of surgery that may be able to fix the issue more permanently. Does that sound OK?","It does, yeah, thank you."

"OK yeah alright so with the. I fall 2 days ago. Things that I'm thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain, so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself, from from the fall which could have pain when you touch it, there could be some swelling and said it would be aggravated by movements. Also could be like injuries to some of that, the ligaments there as well. And however, with this the swelling immobilization for the last two days, as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive that with swelling and a positive Homan in test and your temperature is a little bit elevated today not quite a fever, but feverish. It does increase the suspicion for deep vein thrombosis and so I think the most likely thing right now is actually a DVT or deep vein thrombosis. And so we will order some diagnostic studies, get an ultrasound of your right calf as well as an X Ray of the right knee to to start OK.",OK sounds good. Thank you so much.

"OK, so, uh, yeah with, uh, the symptoms of losing your smell over the last day or so we will certainly look into. Whether or not this is caused by COVID and so that will require a nasal swab test for that. Usually the results are coming back now within 48 hours hopefully, but still will be required to self isolate now for the next 14 days after your symptoms are gone, so we will let you know when the results come back from this test though.","OK.

There are some cases of COVID-19 that, that are more like GI symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms. So I think we should probably give you a COVID swab and then we ask that you and everyone in your house self-isolates for a few days until you've got it in a negative result and in a few days without symptoms.","OK, that sounds good."
"So yeah, we'll get that started for you, and otherwise, really, we want to know if it's COVID is just for infection control purposes, but I think that essentially you should be drinking lots of fluids and getting a lot of rest. And it's something that likely should go away on its own. I mean, if things start to become a lot worse and you get really dehydrated and you have fevers that you can't control with Tylenol, then please come back to the emergency Department. But I think in general it will just be kind of supportive treatments for what you're experiencing.","OK, that sounds good. I'll get some Gatorade on the way home."

"Yeah, so right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or medial collateral ligament strain, or injury and so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDs or anti-inflammatories to help that pain and swelling. If the pain depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain to subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles.",OK.
"But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks and so if it's more more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although that it's most likely an MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well or possibly even a bursitis at the medial aspect of the knee.

Go to other recreational drugs?,No. No other recreational drugs.
"OK, that's good. Do you drink alcohol?","Uh, nope, not anymore. I used to probably drink some wine here and there, but I've stopped drinking alcohol too."

"OK. Uhm, alright, and then any recent sick contacts?",No.
"No, OK, how about uhm, uh travel anywhere?",No.
"No, OK, that's good. And now I'm just going to get you to do the physical exam part of this interview with me, is that OK?",Yeah.
"OK, so we'll take a look at, if you can, if you have a mirror, we'll take a look at both hips first. Do you notice any redness or swelling on those hips?","No, not really."
"No, OK. How about any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes?",No.
"No, OK. And then how about on your knees? Do you see any redness or swelling there?","Not really, no."
"No. Any atrophy, deformity, or skin changes there?","Uh, no."
"No, OK. I'm gonna get you to palpate your hipbones. Does that hurt?","No, not really."
"OK, how about when you do that to your knees?","Uh, the knee I can feel a little bit of I would say it's more of a discomfort then tenderness."
"OK, so some discomfort on the patella palpation. Uhm, alright and then when you palpate those areas, do you feel like there is a grading sensation? How, does it feel warm?",No.
"No, OK. And then I'm gonna get you to, can you flex your hips all the way so bend so from a sitting position stand up first? Does it hurt when you extend your hips like that?","Not right now. I think, I'm pretty sure my hips are pretty well rested right now, but there is still a little bit of stiffness."
"OK. OK, so some stiffness on hip extension. How about when you bend your hips all the way?","Yeah, that's a I can't really go down that far. But yeah, even bending, as much as I can, there is some discomfort there."
"OK, so some discomfort and some pain on hip flexion as well as limited range of motion.",Mhmm.
"OK. Alright, and when you do both of those, do you hear any like what's called a crepitus or like a grating sensation where you feel like bone maybe hitting bone?","No, not really."
"No, OK. Alright, and I'm going to get you to, uh, extend your knee, so straighten it out. Yeah, does that hurt?","Uhm, yeah, a little stiffness in my knees. I feel like I feel more of the grating sound in my knees."
"OK, OK. And then how about when you bend your knees all the way backwards? You can do one at a time.","Uh, yeah I, yeah I definitely feel some discomfort there as well."
"Yeah, OK. Alright, and how about when you point your toes to the ceiling?","No, that's fine. I can do that."
And then how about when you point your toes to the ground?,Yeah no issues.
"OK, so no pain or limited range of motion with plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. OK, so those were all the test that I want to do with you today. Did you have any questions or concerns?","Uh, no, not really."
"No, OK, uhm, so it sounds like what you may have is something called arthritis, which basically happens, uhm, when the cushions at the ends of your bones and your joints kind of degenerate over the years, and so bone can eventually rub on bone, which causes like the grading sensation and causes the pain. Uhm, and it's it happens in old age, it happens with wear and tear so to diagnose it, we we'll, yeah, we did the physical exam. We can also get an x-ray of your hips and knees which can have some findings that align with osteoarthritis and basically for now we'll try to manage it conservatively so you can take and sets like ibuprofen for the pain or acetaminophen for the pain. We'll also refer you to physiotherapy to strengthen those muscles around your joint and to increase flexibility and reduce that pain. Uhm, and another thing that may be worth considering is occupational therapy because they can help you find ways to do everyday tasks without putting too much stress on an already painful joint. And if these things don't work in the future, we can also discuss things like steroid injections or joint replacement. Does that sound like a good plan?","Yeah, that sounds great, thank you so much."

"OK, and are you feeling any pain down into your neck or into your shoulders or back?","No, no."

Oh OK. Have you been uh confused or concerns with your memory?,"Um, no, I haven't forgotten things. It just feels like I'm really slow at doing things."
"I see, OK, and how has your energy been? Have you had uh significant fatigue?","Yes, I would say I am significantly more tired than I used to be."

"Yeah OK, no worries, and any allergies?",Just seasonal allergies.

"So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?","OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something? 'Cause I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up."
"Oh yeah, you're you're absolutely right, so, um sorry, I we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics.","OK, alright that sounds good, thank you."

And you have been feeling feverish over the past two days. Did you measure, did you check your temperature last week?","I didn't check it last week, but I checked it yesterday and it was 38.2, I think."
OK.,"But yeah, but but those are the symptoms that that I've been having."
"Uhm, so it sounds like you your symptoms have evolved quite a bit over the past two weeks. It could have, it could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and might you might have like a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. Uhm, we, we'll do a physical exam. Have a listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth, look at your throat. Uhm, we, uhm, I guess the original symptoms you had last week., uhm, were seem a little bit different. It could be pharyngitis, maybe what you have right now could potentially be pharyngitis with a sore throat and the fever that you've developed over the past three or four days. So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test. Uhm, and we would also have to do a Covid test just in case, and I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 20 for 24 to 48 hours. Just self isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know what to do.","OK, yeah, that sounds good."

"Yeah, for sure. So that is quite high on my differential right now just because of your age, your smoking history and just the way you're presenting. So we're gonna do a couple of things. We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers? How does that sound?","Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much."
How may I help you?,

"Hey Doc, I'm a 45 year old man coming in, I'm worried there's a little old rash on my leg that I'm getting nervous about.","Hi, so you I understand you have a rash on your leg."
"I don't really know what I would call it. That's what I told the nurse when I came in, but it more hurts than anything.","OK, uh, how long is this been going on for?"
"Ah, it's been it's been looking weird for about a week, but only yes, it started hurting yesterday and started looking strange and I just wanted to come in to get it checked out.","OK when you say it's looking strange, can you tell me what you mean by that?"
"Swollen, it looks bigger than it did before, and meaner, if that makes sense.","Swollen OK, is it red?"
"Yeah, it's red, it's turning more red, kind of in the area around it. I've got these I got these scabs. I've got diabetes and I'm not exactly the best with it and scratching at it, and normally it's not that bad, but this is just strange looking and there's no other word for it.","OK, have you ever had anything like this before? I guess you kinda just said that you didn't, but I'll just double check."
"No no. Well I've had,  I have occasional ulcers and sometimes I have banged my toe when I'm not exactly the best taking care of my feet, but this is the first time I've gotten something that I don't know, I've just never seen it before.",Do you have any ulcers right now?
"Let me see. I think so, when's the last time I saw the family doc? I think I've got an ulcer on my left heel, but I think it's doing alright.","OK, and what leg are you having this problem with?"
"Right now it's on my right, so my ankle.","OK, how have your sugars been controlled recently?"
"I stopped measuring them. Yeah, last time I measured it was pretty bad. I think my A1C last time was like 9 something. I'm trying, I'm trying better to be with it. It's hard with work you know?","For sure, I can imagine so, in general, even if you don't know your numbers for your sugars, have you felt worse than usual lately? Have you felt rundown at all?"
"Yeah, actually I have gained more, feel hungry, sometimes just tired, but it's hard to tell. There's an awful lot going on in my life right now with the kids, but, It's hard to tell I think. Yeah, I need to see my family doc.","OK. Definitely you know a good a good idea moving forward just to make sure you get on top of these things, but I'm glad you came in today so we can, you know, have a better look at you and make sure that there's nothing super concerning going on. So in addition to this, have you had any other new symptoms?"
"Symptoms? Um, I feel a little hot actually. When the swelling started it's it also started leaking this like white stuff from one of the one of what used to be a scab so now like kind of an open wound now.","OK, OK so when did you start feeling hot?"
"Honestly, last 12 hours.","OK, you take your temperature at all?"
"No, I don't have a thermometer at home.",Have you had any difficulty breathing?
No no.,Any chest pain?
No.,"Have you noticed that your left, sorry, your right leg feels any hotter than the left?"
"Yeah, yeah it does. Actually changing socks the other day, yeah.","Right. Say, have you alone have you felt ill recently? Have you been sick at all?"
"Aside from just feeling overall crummy last couple weeks, no don't really, less energy today, but I was up last night thinking about this and yeah wanted to come in and talk.","OK yeah, you did the right thing. I'm glad that you're in today. Is the pain on your legs worse when you touch it?"
"Yeah, maybe not so much when I touch it. When I walk with it and I start flexing it it, it doesn't like that.","OK, uhm."
"Just resting it right now, it feels fine.","It's OK, OK. OK, well I'm going to if I think of any more questions specifically about your leg I will, I'll go back to it, but I'm going to just move on and ask you questions about your overall health. You've already shared with me that you you are diabetic. Do you have any other chronic conditions that you live with?"
"Chronic condition? I see the family doc about cholesterol. I'm on a pill for that. Uhm, I had asthma as a kid, not too much of an issue now. And my back, I've had back pain for the last 10 years, but all I really take for it is Tylenol Advil for that.","OK, oh my other question about your leg was, have you lost any feeling in it?"
"It kind of is like a dull ache sometimes when I touch it. But, no like,  in the area, the ankle no, but definitely on my feet, like over the years I've noticed I feel less on it compared to what I did previously, yeah.","OK, so sorry I kind of sidetracked there so we talked about your diabetes. You said you have high cholesterol. So what medications are you currently taking?"
"I'm taking 4 pills right now. One of them is for the cholesterol. I think it's called. rosuvastatin. The other three, they're all diabetes medications, but I don't remember. Metformin is one of them. Sidas...something I have a list somewhere. I'll give it to you later.","OK, are you on insulin right now?"
No.,"Are you on any or any of these medications new to you, recently?"
"No no, but had them for about a year now.",Do you have any allergies?
"Um, yeah, I do actually. Penicillin, can't take that.",And what happens when you take penicillin?
"It's been a while, as a kid apparently like my face got bloated and I was having a hard time breathing so...","Well, we will make sure that we don't give you that. Can you tell me if you've had any previous surgery?"
"Oh yeah, uh, what was it? I had my sinuses, had some pretty bad sinusitis when I was in my teens and they went in and kind of carved a little space out.","OK, OK. Is that the only surgery that you had?"
Yeah.,"And can you tell me, do you have any family history of diabetes, skin problems, anything else that stands out to you?"
"Yep, mom's side of the family, very much everyone has diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol. Dad's side of the the family is pretty healthy. I think maybe one of my aunts had lung cancer, but she's a pretty big smoker too.",And then just ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. So you said that you have children.
"Yeah, I do.",Do you live in town? Do you live with your kids?
I live in town. I see my kids every two weeks.,"And, uh. What do you do for work? Did I already ask you this?"
"No, I'm currently unemployed and looking for work, partially employed, I suppose we should say I have my own business.","I see and, what do you, what do you do when when you are working, ideally?"
"When I am working, I'm an accountant.","OK well, and do you smoke?"
"Yeah once in a while, yeah, when I'm stressed.",How much do you smoke on average?
"Last couple of weeks, I've been smoking more, maybe like 2 packs a week.",OK. Do you drink alcohol?
Yeah yeah.,How much do you typically drink?
"Average week, maybe a 2 4.",So maybe like 3 per day or something like that if you were to average it out?
"Yeah, if you average out I mainly go through the two four in a weekend to be honest.","Oh, I see. OK, more so on the weekend, so maybe a little bit more than three per day on those days?"
Mhm.,OK so that that that's everything that I need to ask you for now. I'd like to get a closer look at this leg. Did you have any other questions or concerns before we move forward to the physical exam?
No I just want to get this figured out.,"OK, yeah, we will definitely do that for you. So yeah, I'm going to have a look at it and then after that I will go talk to the doctor that I'm working with and we'll see what we can do for you. That sounds good?"
"Thank you doc, yeah sounds great.",Awesome OK thanks.

"Yeah, certainly. So, I, so it's sounds like you have the common cold or a viral illness, which it could be caused by something like adenovirus or there are others as well. However, the symptoms do overlap with COVID. As you can be like nonspecific symptoms, such as having kind of just like a runny nose like you do here, and so we will do a COVID swab and we'll await those results, but in the meantime it's mostly supportive care, so it means just trying to stay hydrated, stay rested. And just monitor your symptoms because if things do get worse, it'll be important to, uh, go to the emergency room.",OK.
"Alright, so we'll get the swab now and get that testing started.","OK, that sounds great, thank you."

I'll bring up some some sputum in it and I'm ok, but it's carried on throughout the day."
"OK, uhm, and, was your sputum and greenish yellow before as well? Or was it just starting yesterday or, or couple days ago?","Yeah, that's new. That's just starting new. It was more like, I don't know, whitish? Or yeah, white I guess, before?"

Sore throat?,No.

OK. Any other diagnosis?,"Yeah, I have high blood pressure. Aortic stenosis, uh, and uh, and high cholesterol."

You can take care of the house so and all that not OK on my own, but it certainly gets gets lonely there."
I'm sure. What about what about things like walking? Do you use a cane or a walker?,"Uhm, no, I don't."
"OK and do you are able to bathe on your own, dress on your own? Do you need help?","Oh yeah, those things are OK."
"OK, have you ever have you been on oxygen at all?","No, I haven't, but I feel like I could be right now. It's like, really, I'm short of breath."
"Yeah, yeah, we can definitely do that here. Uhm, alright. So, given your symptoms, it sounds like maybe you're having a COPD exacerbation, potentially. Do you feel like you might have had contact with anyone who was sick?",Not that I can think of.
"OK, have you traveled at all, outside the country or outside the province?","No, I I've just been helping out at the golf course, but that's all. Kind of outside."
Are you wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing?,"Yeah, we are like, I'm like helping out with cleaning the carts and kind of helping out with the grounds."
"Mhmm, OK, alright. So we'll do a Covid swab here just in case. And seeing that you're not feeling very well, you might require oxygen, we're going to keep you here in the ER, and we might have to, you might have to be hospitalized. We'll measure your vitals, do a physical exam, do a chest x-ray and you might be having, as I mentioned earlier, in exacerbation, upper COPD or a worsening of your COPD, potentially because you might have an infection, either a viral infection or bacterial infection that can sometimes worsen your COPD symptoms. You might be started on an antibiotic we'll be putting you in oxygen and giving you some steroid some, are you actually about that, are you, are you using any puffers at home?","Ah, yeah, so yeah I have been using uh, sorry I I have been using ventolin and there was a daily inhaler, Spiriva, I believe. I've been using that each day."
"OK great great yeah so we'll be, we'll be giving you some puffers here as well, and yeah, we'll see how things go. Do you have any questions?","Uh, no, that that sounds good. Thank you."
I understand that you've been having some diarrhea. Can you tell me a little bit about that?,"Yeah, sure I had, I've been having diarrhea for the past three to four days, and it's been pretty bad. I couldn't go, uh I couldn't go to my classes, had to skip because it was just it was just embarrassing."
"OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Uh, have you ever experienced something like this before?","Um, have I experienced something like this before? Uhm no, I don't think so."
"OK. And over the three or four days, have your stools all been loose? Or have you had some solid ones in between?","I think they've mostly been loose. I think they've all been loose actually, if I think about it."
"OK, and how many times a day have you been having episodes of diarrhea?","Oh my god, I have I've lost count. I'm going every every hour."
"OK, every hour. OK, and then you notice any changes in the color of your stool?","No, it's brown."
OK. Any blood in your stool that you've noticed?,Um not really. I don't think so. I don't look that much to be honest.
"OK, um have you noticed any any pain associated with it?","Well, I didn't start off with pain, but I I I do have a bit of a cramp now since yesterday. It's just it hurts. Yeah, it hurts sometimes, it comes and goes."
"OK, and do you feel that when it, do you feel that you still have control over like releasing it to like does it come on and you don't even notice that it has happened or you still are able to kind of have a warning before you get to the toilet?","Uh no I do get a warning, but it's just I I do need to get to the toilet really fast, yeah."
"OK, and before this happened, have you noticed, have you, is there anything that you've done differently that you've been eating differently, or any other changes that have happened in your life recently?","Um, I I did go to um, I did go to a new restaurant 5 days ago."
"OK, what did you have there?","Um  I I just got some rice with chicken Manchurian, it was a nice little Chinese restaurant, and yeah."
Did anyone else have the same thing that you did that you were with?,"Um, no not really, I went with my friend and I haven't really, haven't talked to her about this. I never really thought that these were related, that this was related to that."
"And then it's, you know, absolutely, potentially not like, maybe not. It could possibly be so not to not to worry you about that. We just like to get an idea of kind of the whole picture of what you're coming in with. So in terms of the last three to four days, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?","Yeah yeah, I have actually, but it's not been as bad as the diarrhea. I didn't even yeah, I didn't, I wasn't even thinking about that. Yeah, I I did vomit, I think twice yesterday."
"OK, have you noticed any blood in the vomit?","No, it's just watery."
"And are you nauseated all the time, or is it kind of on and off?",It's on and off.

"OK, that's really good. Uh, uh, congratulations.",Thank you.
"Yeah, and other than that, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?","Uh, no, I don't. OK, how about alcohol?"
"I'll have a glass of wine sometimes, but very rarely.","OK. Um yeah, so those are just some of the questions I had for you now. I just wanted to ask a few questions regarding just physically examining the joints that hurt. So when you look at those joints, do you notice any kind of swelling, redness, or when you feel any warmth to them?"
"Yes I yeah I do. I feel swelling, warmth and redness.","OK, and do you notice any kind of deformities, for example like you're not able to bend your finger or any kind of deformities that you didn't see before? Or, like, for example, your wrist is turned uh, outwards a little bit. Anything like that?"
"Uh, no, nothing like that, no deformity.","No deformities. OK, when you go over your joints, do you notice any kind of like nodules or harder materials that don't seem to be your bones?"
"Not really, no. No, I don't notice anything like that. They just share a bit larger from the swelling it feels like.","OK, I see. Are you able to make a fist with both both hands?"
"Not completely, I can close my hands part of the way, but I can't make a full fist.",I see. OK and are you able to completely extend your fingers and show your palms?
Yeah I can do. I can do that.,OK. And are you able to walk without a limp or anything like that?
"Um, yes I can.","OK. Alright, so those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
"Um no, I'm just wondering what what this could be.","Yeah, so from what you're describing to me you do fit into. The age range and all the symptoms are kind of point towards arthritis, and in this case it sounds more like rheumatoid arthritis. Ddefinitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate just in case as well. But given that it's symmetrical, you have the morning stiffness that doesn't go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis, especially since you've also, you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism, it's more likely to be another autoimmune condition. So what we will do is get a few tests done. This will involve some blood work as well. And we will also get some imaging done, so we will get like the CRP and ESR for inflammatory markers we will get like your full CBC blood count we will get rheumatoid factor test done as well as antinuclear antibody and a lot of other different just markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get just X-Rays of your hands and feet as well. So does that sound good?"
"It does, yeah, thank you.","You're welcome. And then if it does come out to be rheumatoid arthritis arthritis, which seems likely, you will need a referral to a rheumatologist to manage and treat your, uh, treat you with medications."
How may I help you?,"I've just been experiencing a, some pain and numbness and tingling in in just my wrist area and thumb, middle finger, and index finger."
"OK, and when did this pain start and is it the right hand or or left hand?","Hum, it's the right. It's a the right hand, but I also find it so starting to happen in the left hand as well, but more so on the right hand. I feel this kind of sensation over my palms and fingers it started I would say probably 2 weeks ago. And it's been, I think it's gradually been getting worse. I'm having more difficulty at nighttime, especially. It's also waking me up from sleep, and it's yeah just affecting my daily routine, my work. So yeah, I just wanted to understand what was going on."
"OK, I see and did you have any trauma to the wrist or or any injury, or have you had an injury in the past?","No, I haven't had any falls, no accidents, nothing like that."
OK. And are you right or left handed?,I'm right handed.
"OK yeah, and you mentioned it was the right hand that started to hurt first and then the left one has started since then?","Yeah, yeah, and I don't know if it's just 'cause I use my right hand more that I feel more pain and the symptoms. But yeah, I definitely would say it's worse."
"OK, and where are you finding that the pain is specifically located?","So the pain I feel like it's more like a discomfort. Just over the like palm, like near the wrist and the lower palm area is where the discomfort is and then the numbness and tingling is just like in thumb an the 1st 2 digits."
"OK, and how would you describe the character of this sensation, is it burning, is it sharp, achy or or stabby?","Um I would say it's more of kind of like an aching, aching pain. Um it does sometimes turn into kind of like a burning sensation with the tingling, but yeah, more so on the palmer like on the palm side of things, it's more like an aching pain."
OK. And you have some burning as well?,Yeah.
"OK. And is the does it radiate anywhere, are you feeling this in in your neck, shoulder, or down your arm at all?","It kind of goes from the palm, along, so it goes from the palm it goes upwards like to my fingers, but also backwards like into my lower arm as well. Like my forearm."
"OK, and do you have any pain in the neck?",In my neck?
Yeah.,No.
"OK, an anything that you've done that makes the pain worse?","Uh. I I just have to like I work as an accountant. There's a lot of work I do on the computer with a keyboard mouse, so I feel like it's hard to really do that all day right now. So I think if I do that, I'll make it worse. But if I take a rest and kind of just shake my hands a little bit, then it gets better."
"OK, um so kind of like flicking your wrist sort of thing, so kind of shake out the?",Yeah.
"OK, um an anything that you do that makes it better besides those moves like have you taken any medications or tried any like wrist splints or anything like that?","No, I haven't tried any medications or splints."
"OK, and what is the severity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst you've ever felt and do you feel this pain at any particular time of day more than than others?","The pain is probably like a, a 5,  and I feel it more during the night as well as like when I'm working, I feel it's definitely more as I continue to do more work."

"OK, and how about autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or like hypothyroidism or type one diabetes?",In my family history? I think there is.
Yeah.,"Some, there's definitely some diabetes on my father's side. But other than that, I think one of my aunts on my mother side had um a hysterectomy for cancer."
"OK, alright and was it endometrial cancer?","Not sure actually, but she I just know that she had her uterus removed."
I see alright and um so next I wanted to just move to the physical exam portion and so just first inspecting the hand and wrist do you see any swelling or redness?,No.
"How about any changes to temperature, do any of the joints feel warm?",No.
And are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of the joints in the hand?,"Uhm, maybe like just a little bit like I feel like I've lost some of like the fat pad just right near my thumb."
I see OK. And is there any areas of your hands over like any of the joints or over the rest that if you press you feel pain?,Um no.
OK and are you able to to move your wrist or the full range of motion?,"Yeah, I can move it."
"OK, uh. And is there any, uh, so that then the next test I'll just ask you to just tap on the the kind of base of your palm there with your index finger and middle finger of your left hand, and when you do that, do you feel any burning or tingling?",Yeah yeah. I definitely do.
"OK, so that would be, yeah, positive Tinel sign and do you get any, so if you flex both of your wrists so that the back of your hands are pressing against each other. And if you hold that position, do you start to get symptoms of the burning and tingling?","Um yeah, I do feel it as well there."
"OK, alright so that was everything I wanted to ask about and check today um did you have any questions?","No, I just wanted to know how I can fix this."
"Yeah, certainly so it's sounding like a carpal tunnel syndrome which that the differential would be something like radiculopathy coming up up from the neck, which you're not having any neck symptoms and the positive Tenel sign and positive Phalen sign are highly suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, along with the nighttime symptoms and the burning and tingling sensation you're experiencing. And so to help with this one of the first things that that can be done is trying to use like wrist splints at night to try to keep your hand in a neutral position, but also, uh depending on like if there is inflammation there NSAIDs might help a little bit like ibuprofen or or things like that. But the majority of the therapy will be kind of an activity modification, and if symptoms don't improve over a period of time, then surgery could be a potential option as well.","OK, sounds good."
I've been having issues with just a cough that's just been constantly like bothering me for the past few bit.,"OK, um, when did this, what can you tell me a little bit more about the cough itself? Any any sputum?"
"So yeah, it it does have some like dark yellow greenish mucus material every time I cough. That's not doesn't always happen, but it's been worse like that keeps happening over the last few days.","OK, and any blood in the sputum?"
No.,"OK, and how much have you been bringing up would you say?"
"I would say every time I bring it up it's around like one teaspoon, usually one teaspoon in the day.","OK, and when did this cough start?"
"Um, so I think it started around like I would say six months ago and it's kind of just coming it just keeps coming and going here and there, but it's recently just starting to get very irritating.","OK, and um any triggers or uh precipitating events for for the cough?"
"So like six months ago I remember I was in just in Phys.Ed and we were just doing some laps and that's when I just really started coughing. And yeah, nothing else was really going on.

OK. So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot?,"No, I think you covered it all.  I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else?"
"Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations.","OK great, thank you."

"But it'll be important to get some blood work and things to make sure that we're not missing that. But for Dupuytren's contracture. It'll be a uh, do doing what we can with therapy to try it like physiotherapy and activity modification to try and loosen those structures on the on the palm of your hand.","OK, sounds good."
What brings you in here today?,"Hi, hi there I've been having this knee pain. It started almost immediately after I was I was playing basketball on the high school team and it was during practice I jumped up for a rebound and I, when I landed I heard a pop of my my left knee and I immediately felt pain.

And also even straightening it out hurts as well if I'm really flexing the muscle, so just trying to stay pretty immobile right now."
"OK, I see. OK, and in terms of other symptoms, any kind of chest pain, shortness of breath?","No, nothing like that."

"OK, no, yeah, that's really that's really good that you're thinking like that. Any issues at school like bullying or do you feel unsafe either at home, around your home environment or at school?","No, I don't feel unsafe. I mean, I know there's always those kids at school who are mean to others. But I mean, I, I generally feel safe."
"OK, alright so I'm just going to ask a few questions about just the examination part of part of this. Do you, so you mentioned you can't flex your knees at all, can you extend them?","Yeah it it can, uh, straighten it out all like most of the way, it seems like it's bent a little still maybe from like the swelling and only I can't straighten it out the full way."
"OK, and then you said you noticed like bruising and kind of like there's blood accumulating in that area?","Yeah exactly yeah, it looks like it. 'cause it's a bit like Brown. I guess I can like see or on my knee I guess like the like a big bruise."
"OK, I see. OK. And. Yeah, so those are kind of like all the questions I had for you. It seems that based on the description of how the injury happened an the mechanism and what you're feeling right now and in terms of the examination, it's possible that you had knee ligament injury. Most likely in this case, the anterior cruciate ligament, but just to make sure we will need to do an MRI of your knee and see which ligament is affected and to what extent. Uh, and usually with the with the depending on what we find on the MRI sometimes it can be just conservative management, but however oftentimes you do require surgery, so it would be. Just a surgery where we put kind of like a scope in into your knee and through the scope we try to fix the ligament. So yeah first, we'll just do the MRI and see to what extent your knee injury is and how how affected the ligaments are, and then we'll go from there. Does that sound OK?","It does. Yeah yeah, thank you."

"It is possible. Uh, it's uh, especially with nonspecific symptoms, COVID can cause a variety of different presentations, and there for some people it can be more gastrointestinal issues like like your son has with vomiting and diarrhea and belly pain. But it also could be well, uh, another type of gastrointestinal virus itself or or a viral illness like the common cold, which can also end up causing symptoms like this as well. So we will, I will go ahead and do a COVID test today, along with some other blood work. And maybe increase the hydration as well, because it sounds like he has lost a lot of fluid over these last couple of days. So we will check electrolytes and go from there on the test results.","Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much."

"Yeah, so this cough, um, it's been going on for the last four days. Since you do have a cough, um and right now that, like, is considered a symptom, like, like a potential symptom for COVID, we definitely want to do a COVID swab test for you, which will come back in 24 hours to 48 hours. You should still try and isolate as much as you can away from any roommates, or family members for the next, so, 14 days since you first experienced the, the cough.",Okay.
"Based on, like, public health will call you as well so you can follow their instructions. And if, it can be anything else too, like, with a cough, there can be multiple things going on. You can have um, like an upper respiratory, viral, or bacterial infection. But since you're not having too many other symptoms right now, it can just be bronchitis. Um, this is something that we'll try and keep an eye on and make sure it's nothing else like, uh pneumonia, for example.

And are you concerned about her breathing?"
"Um, so the, the physical exam and the, the vital signs will really, will help with um, to assess her breathing and to see oxygen levels.",Yeah.
"Um, and um, this could be uh, caused by um, a viral infection, which could be something along the lines of uh, like a common cold type picture, and we can get like inflammation of uh, really small airways, um, and it can cause that cough, and fever, and some of the symptoms that she's experiencing. And also, um, these symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, um, and so it'll be important to get a COVID swab just in case. Um, but um, if that is the, the scenario, then it will be um, supportive care with oxygen, fluids and we'll make sure that um, that her, her breathing is uh, okay. And possibly, we'll need steroids and um, and uh, an inhaler if necessary.","Okay. Okay, that sounds good, thank you."

"Um but it I think it does really sound like you have a common cold um so just like another viral illness, um so just treat it supportively you know um keep yourself hydrated, if you feel like you're getting a fever, take like Tylenol. Um if you have like pain like a headache or like sinus pressure or something you can take again an Advil or Tylenol. Um And if your symptoms worsen, or if you have any neurological symptoms, then you should see the ER um right away.",Sure.

"Yeah, OK, well, it's only been two days so far, let's just keep an eye on your symptoms and see how you're doing. It might also be a good idea just to get a covid swab done, and if your symptoms continue to worsen, give me a call again and we can talk about it a little bit more and see if maybe a bacterial infection or if there's something else that's going on. You don't have any difficulties breathing, do you?","No, I don't."

What brings you in?,"Hi, yes I just came in today because I've been a bit concerned about some breathing difficulties over the last few days. It all started out with like a cough over the last week, but now I'm having trouble breathing as well."
"Oh OK, well I'm sorry to hear that. So you said a cough as well, so the cough at least a week back and the shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, when did that start?","So yeah, the cough, I usually have a cough. I've had COPD for a long time, but this past week the coughing has been much worse with a lot of more sputum and. Other than that, it started I would say two to three days ago. The cough got worse and then every time I'm moving around I like have to sit down and catch my breath, which is pretty abnormal for me."
"OK yeah, so alright. So let's focus on the cough first. You said it's a wet cough?","Yes, I am producing a lot of sputum."
"OK, what color is your sputum?",It's mainly like clear white.
OK yeah so you don't see yellow pus or anything green or bloody in there?,"No, I don't think so. But there's definitely like a lot more than what I usually produce."
"OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?",I would say it's a bit harsh at times. I wouldn't say it's barky or muffled. I do find myself wheezing a little over the last few days as well.
OK. Do you find you have any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?,"Oh no, I don't really have any pains."
"OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this before?","I did a couple of years ago, I had to be admitted because I had some shortness of breath."
OK.,"But that was, I think, two years ago."
"OK. And when you were admitted two years ago, did they tell you what you had?","Yeah, they said I had some kind of lung infection at that time, so they gave me some antibiotics while I was in the hospital."
"OK, did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma, COPD, any longstanding conditions?",Yeah so I've had COPD for more than... I guess more than 10 years now so I think it just got a lot worse with the infection.
"OK yeah alright. So this time around, have you had any fevers?",I've been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go. I didn't really think it was a fever.
"OK, any weight loss?",No.
"OK, how about changes in your hair or nails like or or skin like rashes?","Umm, no."

How about calf pain?,Nope.
Dizziness or fainting spells?,No.
Headaches?,No headaches.
Memory loss or confusion?,Nope.
Changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain?,Nope.
Changes to urinating?,"No, that's all fine"
"OK, so besides the COPD, do you have any other longstanding conditions?","I do have some high blood pressure which I take, I think I take one of these medications called metoprolol."
"OK, and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked?","Umm, probably like a month ago and it was pretty good. I've been checking by myself at home too and it hasn't been changing too much. I think the last one I took was probably like 135 / 80."
"Oh, I see. OK, any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for COPD a year back?","Umm, back when I was a kid I had my tonsils removed."
"OK, are you on any medications besides the metoprolol?","I do take multivitamins.I think that's yeah, that's about it."
Do you take any puffers for your COPD?,"Yeah, so I do have three like different puffers I take. I can't remember the name. I do have some puffers I don't take. I've been using them right now. It has been helping with some of my shortness of breath, but I've definitely been having to use them way more than I used to."
OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?,"Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva."
"OK, sure, Yep.",So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist.
"Just wanna make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist. OK, good. Alright, are you up to date with all your immunizations?","Yeah, I think so."
And are you allergic to anything?,"No, not that I know."
Any family history of lung conditions?,"Umm, no I don't think so. Yeah, no, I don't think so."
OK. How about heart conditions?,"Yeah, my father died of a heart attack in his 60s."
"OK. Alright, any cancers?",My uncle had skin cancer.
"OK. Do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell?","No, I think it wasn't the bad one. It was like the one they can remove right away."
"Oh I see. OK, OK, that's good.Do you smoke?","Yeah, I've been smoking for around, I would say the last 20 years."
"OK, how much do you smoke?",Probably I would say pack a day for the last 20 years.
"Umm, have you ever thought about quitting?","Yeah I did. I did once and then went back onto it. I definitely do smoke less than before though. OK, but yeah, I don't think I'm ready to quit yet."
"OK, yeah no problem. Do you drink alcohol?","Umm, yeah, maybe once a week I would have a small Cup of whiskey."
"OK, sure, that's fine. And any other drugs?","No, no marijuana, no other drugs."
"OK, and where do you live right now?",Right now I live in a small bungalow in London.
"OK, any reasons to believe there are carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering your COPD?","Umm, I don't think so. Everything is pretty up to date."
"OK, have you had any contact with anyone that's been sick recently?","No, I've been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home."
"OK, how about travel to anywhere?","Nope, I've been in Ontario since the beginning of the pandemic."
"Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?","Yeah, I was just worried if it can be COVID or if it's just like another infection that I had like before."
"Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?",Thank you.
Would you mind by starting to tell me what brought you in?,"Yeah, absolutely. Uhm, I don't know, I've just been feeling a little feverish, uhm, and I also have a, a bit of a sore throat."

"OK, uh, any like, changes that, uhm, other symptoms that you've been having with the sore throat?","Yeah, I'm just feeling a little feverish."

"OK, and have you had any, any cough?",No.

And the sore throat was just worse and I felt feverish and tired and I felt really crappy."
"OK, yeah, and have you had any symptoms like this before?","Well yeah, I usually get a cold once a year in the fall. It does feel similar to that."

"OK. And just to, get to know you a little bit better as well. I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?","Sure, yeah, I live with uh, I live with my son and daughter and my grandson."
"OK, uhm, and, uhm, OK, yeah, I think that's all I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to tell me or maybe that I forgot to ask about?","Uh no, I don't think so. Do you think I have covid?"
"It's, it's certainly possible. It will be something we test for.",Sure.
"Although the symptoms that you're experiencing, with feeling or having a fever, sore throat, and not feeling well with the muscle aches and fatigue, uhm, its relatively non-specific, so as you mentioned, it could be something like the common cold, that you've experienced in the past, so we can't rule that out either at this time, but we will do some investigations including a nasal swab for covid and kind of go from there.","OK, sounds good."

"Okay, and do you smoke cigarettes or marijuana, or use any recreational drugs?","No, nothing like that."
"Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. We'll do a full physical examination of the area. Um, we, we will definitely get an x-ray of the shoulder and clavicle to see what kind of, it seems like you have a clavicular fracture from just the mechanism of the injury, as well as everything you were describing. Um, but it is important to understand how, like what kind of clavicle injury it is and where it's affected, if it's in the middle area, on like the outer areas of the clavicle, um, and how much it's displaced because that will determine if we just need to reduce it here, and then give you a sling, and then you can go home. That's usually the case, but sometimes you may require surgery as well, and we would need to refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon. So yeah, we'll, we'll get the x-ray done, and if you need anything for pain currently, we will give you some medications here, um and then we'll go from there.","Alright, thank you."

"OK. And uh like how would you describe the the pains in your hand, like dull, achy, sharp?","I would say the pain is more like a tingling sensation. Um so I guess the tingling is is like a sharp feeling, um I wouldn't call it so much pain as I would just like tingling and numbness."
"OK. OK, and uh is is there anything, so you mentioned sort of the driving and using your phone, are there any other activities that make it worse?","Recently I found it's hard for me to hold things um in my right hand, so like if I'm trying to open up a jar um like it's hard for me to hold it, and sometimes I find uh like it'll just fall out of my hand."
"OK, so you're like dropping items and stuff?","Mhmm, yes."

What brings you here today?,"Um so I'm here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week um and any movement of that shoulder, of my right shoulder, causes a lot of pain."
"OK, and how long have you been having uh this pain for?","For the past week,"
"Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?","Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago."
"OK, and where is this pain located exactly?","Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder."
"OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?","So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain."
"Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?",Uh any movement.
 OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?,"Um I think um, like no, anything hurts."

"Seven, OK.",Yeah.
"And are you having uh, is this pain moving to any other uh joints or any other part of your body?",No.
"OK, so just just in the area that you described?",Yes.
"OK, and do you notice any kind of um, just looking at your shoulder outside, from the outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities?","No, I don't see anything like that."
"OK, alright and um is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain?","Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily."
"OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy?","Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that."
"I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?","Uh no, nothing like that."
"OK, and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick?",No.
"OK, any any weight loss um or loss of appetite? Anything like that?","Uh no, nothing like that."

"And are you off of work right now, or have you been off work um due to your previous injury and pain, or are you still working?","I'm still working, but modified, um so I am not uh lifting any heavy objects or anything like that. I'm just doing some like groundwork."
"OK, that's good. Yeah, I mean, um we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of overhead like work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders, that might uh, cause further problems as well, so we'll look into some of those modified duties as well.",OK.
"Um yeah, and what is your living situation like right now? Who do you live with?",Um I live by myself right now.
Do you live in a house or apartment?,Um I live in an apartment.
"And, uh, uh, in terms of your daily life, do you smoke at all?","Um I don't smoke. I used to smoke before, but that was like 20 years ago."

"How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?",I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.
"OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?",I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.
"OK, but otherwise it's not tender?",No.
"OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?",Yeah.
"OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?",The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.
Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?,"It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts."
" OK, alright, so yeah, so based on what um you've told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury, what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries, you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called uh adhesive capsulitis, or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder. And there's different stages, so that might happen, so in the initial stages like freezing um and then there's stiffening in stage two, and then usually after 6 to 12 months it starts uh getting better.",OK.
"Um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well. So what we'll um end up doing today is see if um we can get some um imaging done so we can do an X-Ray of your shoulder. I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder.",OK.
"For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?",That sounds pretty good. Thank you.
"Welcome, alright, so we'll call you for the X-Rays and then we'll go from there.","OK, sounds good."
So what brings you in here today?,So I've had this stuffy nose for the past three days. I'm getting some yellow discharge from the nose. I can't seem to smell well. And I have had this terrible headache for the past two days as well.
"OK, so just to kind of get a timeline, what kind of started first?","So first, my nose was kind of stuffy. And and then I started having this yellow discharge from the nose and then I kind of lost some of my smell. And then now my head hurts.

"Yeah, have you tried any medications, over the counter medications at all?",I tried some nasal sprays. And like decongestions but it's not really helping.
"OK. And so you've tried nasal sprays? Have you tried any of those, like nasal rinses, or anything like that?","Yeah, and they don't seem to be helping."

"OK, and have you noticed at all or has someone told you that your breath might smell bad? Or have you noticed it yourself?","Oh gosh, I hope not, no. No one said that."

"OK. Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?","Uh, no, what was like, what do you think I have?"
"Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?","No, I haven't."
"OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin.",Sure.
"So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that? Have you measured your temperature?","I haven't, I haven't, no."
OK.,I don't feel hot though.
"OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?",Yeah that sounds great. Thank you.
"OK, you're welcome and hopefully you feel better.",Thank you.
Take care.,You too.

So just wondering if he would need to be hospitalized again and if he needs antibiotics."
"Yeah, for sure it's, it's been uhm, so it's been three or four days, but with a fever this high and his symptoms, with uh, having obstruction, discharge, uhm, changes to smell or loss of smell it does sound like it could be bacterial and so I think it would be reasonable to possibly to start antibiotics in this case, but we'll go through, through a physical exam, check some vitals and go from there.","Ok, Ok, sounds good, thank you."

"Yeah, so we will definitely do a Covid swab on you because you have a cough, um and those results should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours, and so you'll know more then. But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing. So, I am going to review your medications and if your family Doc also agrees, we may try uh another um blood pressure medication for you instead of ramipril.",Sure.
Um so we'll try and change that medication and see if your coughing stops. How does that sound?,Sounds great.

Um, do you think um, I need to be hospitalized, um, because I'm very short of breath, or do you think I can just um, stay at home? Do you think I need antibiotics?"
"Yeah, so we'll, we'll check your temperature and, and confirm the fever and um, check your oxygen levels as well. You might need oxygen, um, you're mentioning, with your shortness of breath. Um, and we will get a chest x-ray, and if um, we're seeing consolidation there, suggestive of pneumonia, you may need antibiotics that will cover, cover those, those bugs. However, your symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, and so it will be important to get a, um, COVID swab. But to answer if you will need a hospital stay, I think we'll need to at least wait until some of the investigations come back and, um, that will help determine how severe the symptoms are and we'll observe you over the next few hours, and if you are getting any worse or um, anything like that, then it might be a good idea, um, to uh, to be admitted.","Okay.

"Okay, and uh, where would you say you're getting the chest pain?","Um, it's mostly like centre of my chest, like, close to my, like I'd say it's like it feels like, it's not my like, it doesn't feel like it's inside. It feels more like it's pushing up on, on my chest wall."

"Yeah so, right now it's definitely something that's on everyone's mind. Um some of these symptoms, um the shortness of breath and fever, definitely can be COVID, and that's something that we are going to test you with, and that's something we test everyone with. Um, but because you're having shortness of breath, uh, we do need to make sure nothing else is going on as well. Uh you can potentially have pneumonia that's not COVID, it can be any other virus or bacteria, so we will get some blood work done, we'll get your temperature and all your vitals taken as well, um and then get a chest x-ray as well.",Okay.
"And if it turns out at all that you have pneumonia, we'll just reassess and see if you need to stay in the hospital for longer, if you need any antibiotics within the hospital, or you can take them at home.

"Okay, you're not bringing up any sputum or any other material?",No.
"And uh, are you coughing up any blood by any chance?",No.
"For the shortness of breath, can you describe it a little bit? Is it, are you having trouble taking deep breaths, or are you breathing faster? Can you describe it?","Yeah, I just feel like um, I'm getting out of breath really easily, just like um, walking even, walking to the kitchen from my bedroom, I'm getting short of breath and it, it just started yesterday morning, it's so odd."
"Okay, and have you had anything like this happen before to you?",No.

Um, that should come back in the next 24 to 48 hours and then public health will contact you. Um, yeah, based on what you're telling me so far, we will definitely do a physical examination, get your vitals, and get your oxygenation and everything done. But I also think, since you were very drowsy and were, had fallen asleep and were really difficult to wake up, sometimes you can get what's called aspiration pneumonia. Um, and that's, that can also be a possibility and what we will do is get a chest x-ray, get some blood work done as well today. Um, now we may require antibiotics, and if your vitals unstable we might actually admit you as well. Um, does that sound good?",Yeah.
"Alright, so yeah, we'll get those tests done and we'll be there with you shortly. We'll also get like an EKG done as well.",Sure.
What brings you in today?,"Uh, yeah, so I, I just came in because I've been having, for the last, I would say 2 weeks, just a lot of congestion in my nose and then I've also been feeling a lot of pressure in my head as well as just, around my jaws and my face overall."
"Okay, and um, you said it started two weeks ago. Has it gotten better or worse, or been the same since then?","Um, I'd say it's pretty much been the same, except like the pressure's getting worse."
"Okay, and do you find that the pressure is worse when you're bending down, or um, yeah, when you're like squatting or sitting down?","Um, when I'm sitting down, I don't think so, but like sometimes I do feel like, for example, when I'm lying on one side, it gets really bad on that one side and I have to kind of switch over to the other side."
"Okay, alright. And uh, when did your headaches start?","Um it's, I guess it's not so much as a headache as just kind of um, just pain in and around the cheeks and just going up to my head. And it started about, I would say around 2 weeks ago."

"Okay good, good, good. Um, any uh, anything that makes the, that makes it worse? I know that lying on one side, you said, makes things worse for you. Anything else that's made the pressure worse?","Um, no, I would say that's, that's about it."
"Okay, any changes in your sense of smell?","Yeah, definitely. Uh when I get really stuff, stuffy, like I don't really smell anything."
What about sense of taste?,"Um taste, I guess, like with the smell gone sometimes like the taste feels weird too, but like not, not really."
"I see, okay. Um, and any family history of any medical conditions?","Um my, my father did have a heart attack in his uh, I think it was late 50s, but he's well and alive right now, so he's fine."
"Good. Alright, well that's all the questions I had for you given the symptoms that you've shared with me, it sounds like you might have something called um, rhinosinusitis, uh which is basically inflammation of the sinuses and of the uh, of the nasal cavity or the area inside your nose, and uh, often it's just treated with conservative management, so just continue to take um, Tylenol if that seems to help you, and do the steam therapy. It will take time to get better, um, but if you feel that it's um, it's not getting better in the next week or so, give us a call again and we can maybe see if it's a bacterial infection and see if um, if antibiotics might be needed but oftentimes it's usually a viral infection, and antibiotics are not needed, and sort of just resting and taking care of yourself, um, and trying to manage the symptoms that way can help. Um, but also check your temperature here to see if you have any fevers and uh, go from there. We'll also, I guess, we'll also do a COVID swab because your symptoms do overlap with some of those symptoms. Um, and we'd recommend that you quarantine until at least uh swabs, swab results are out and then public health will let you know what to do.",Okay.
Do you have any questions for me?,"Uh no, that's all. Thank you so much."
How can I help you?,"Hi, my son Dave who's 5 years old, who comes to the clinic quite often, has uh, his asthma has been really bad over the past few days. I've tried his puffers, but they're not really helping much, and I'm just worried about him."

"That's great, and has he been using any other medications to help over these last couple of days besides the inhalers?","No, just the inhalers, we've also kept it the usual one, the one that he takes, the other inhaler."

"For sure, yeah, we'll, uh, check his his vital signs and do a physical exam. And it does sound like it could be an asthma exacerbation, and so we can trial some inhaler medications, a little bit different than what you use at home. But also using Ventolin as well and we'll assess the need for potential, uh, antibiotics and also steroid if necessary and if his breathing gets worse or you're starting to hear that the wheezing is getting worse or his work of breathing is becoming more intense then certainly we'll need to add on some oxygen and possibly, some other therapies.",Thank you so much doc.

But it's, uh, and then, uh, also we'll get some blood work and a chest x-ray. But it is sounding like this could be a heart failure exacerbation. Which, so some of the shortness of breath, it could be coming from fluid, uhm, that has accumulated in your lungs and so, uh, we'll give you, oh, another type of water pill now, Furosemide, to try and help get rid of some of that fluid so it will help with the breathing.

"Tends to get pretty bad, like I don't really have any right now, but I really stay on top of it with like my moisturizers and like I always have like a hydrocortisone cream on hand just in case.","Yeah, for sure. How long have you had eczema for?"
"Oh, like when I was, started when I was like a kid and then I feel like when I was a teenager I didn't really, and then part of it as an adult I really have to take care of it or else it gets bad.","OK OK. Um, have you ever been hospitalized or have you had any surgeries in the past?"
"Uh, like when I was first diagnosed with Crohn's maybe 20 years ago, when I was like 20, I was in the hospital for a little bit 'cause I was really dehydrated and I couldn't really like, I just couldn't I wasn't feeling well at that time, but since then I've been pretty on top of it.","OK, that's good to hear. You mentioned you're on biologics for Crohn's disease? Are there any other medications that you're on?"
"Um, just like the hydrocortisone, cream on occasion.","Right. OK. Um, OK and. Do you have any allergies?"
"Ah, like I have some seasonal allergies, like ah, its ragweed, which is not like right now, is not the time for it. And like cats and dogs.",OK. OK.
"It's just like this environmental, it's not like not like the really dangerous allergies, you know?","Right, OK. Um, how about immunizations? Are you up to date?"
I think so.,"Alright, and in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?"

"Uh, no.",No marijuana? OK. Um? How about other recreational drugs?
"Uh, no.","No, OK. Uhm, alcohol?"
"Ah, I like I might have like a couple beers on the weekend, but not a lot.","Sure, um. And where do you live right now?"
"So I live in a townhouse in London here. I live alone, but my I have my kids every, I have my kids like Wednesdays and Thursdays and then every other weekend.","OK, any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos, anything like that in the home?"
"No, it's like a pretty new build.","OK, and have you been around any sick contacts recently?"
"Ah I mean, my kids just left this weekend. Uhm, there's really only people I've been around. I can, I maybe I should have asked him before coming here if they like knew they had seen anyone but they were fine, over the weekend.","OK. Um, and have you traveled to anywhere recently?"
No.,"No, OK. Those were all the questions that I had today were there was there anything else that you wanted to add? Anything that I missed perhaps?"
I don't think so. I think that's it.,OK.
"You know, I hope I hope I just wanted to come in in case it was something bad because I you know I have those other health problems. I just want to make sure. Yeah.","Yeah, yeah for sure and I think it's a good thing that you came in, so thank you. Right now, I guess top on the list of things that you could possibly have is COVID, so we'll get you tested for that and we'll get you a swab and you should have the results of the that swab in about 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days regardless though because your symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID. And, and that includes isolating from your your children as well."
Oh ok.,"And yeah, and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year, just so just make sure you're staying hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods and getting good sleep. If your symptoms do become worse, and if they become uhm, severe like you have a really high temperature, you have trouble breathing or you have any neurological symptoms like seizures or fainting spells, please do go to the ER and seek help. How does that sound?"
"Ah yeah, I guess that sounds good. This is how it's gotta be, right?","Yeah, unfortunately, or yeah. Well, thank you again."
"No, thank you. Have a good day.",You too.
What brings you in?,"So yeah, I've just been having a cough for the last week and I think I had a little bit of a fever in the last few days."
"OK, so you said the cough started a week ago?","Yeah, around a week ago OK and the fever started two to three days ago. Yeah, I haven't really measured it, but like I definitely have been feeling chills.I've been wearing like multiple blankets over the last few days."
"Ok, have you taken your temperature? You said you haven't taken your temperature right?",No.
OK. So let's focus on the cough. Is it persistent or does it come and go?,I think the cough is pretty persistent over the last week.
"OK, and does it get worse with like cold air or dust? Like maybe pets or anything like that?","No, I think it stays around the same."
"OK, umm, does it get better with anything? Have you tried any over the counter cough syrup?","Yes, I tried tylenol cold and liked it. I think it made it a bit better, like it helped me sleep. Other than that, during the day, it's still around the same."
"OK, and how would you describe this cough? Is it barky? Is it harsh? Does it sound muffled?",How I would say is that it's kind of like it's not too harsh. It's more like a wet cough. I'm definitely bringing up some some sputum.
"OK, um, what color is the sputum?","It's usually like a, uh like a white and sometimes like a little bit yellow as well."
"OK, is it ever green or do you ever see blood in there?","No, I haven't seen any of that."

"OK, any shortness of breath?","No, no."
How about wheezing?,"No, I don't think I've recently."
"D:OK, chest pain?",No chest pain.
How about swelling? Have you noticed any swelling in like your legs or arms or your belly area?,"No, I don't think so."

Joint pain or muscle ache?,"No, I don't think so."
OK. Any Contacts with sick people around you recently?,"My wife was actually just sick last week, but she recovered. She did have a fever for one of the days and she also had a cough."
"OK, did she get it checked out in a clinic?","No, I don't think so. She did get that COVID test done, but it came back negative and she didn't go to the doctor or anything. It kind of just went away on its own."
"OK, any travel recently?",No.

OK. Any cancers in the family?,I do have an aunt on my mother's side who had ovarian cancer.
"OK, how old was she when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer?",I think probably in her 50s.
"OK, and do you smoke?","No, I don't smoke."

"OK, sure and by joint, you said once a month right?","Yeah, once per month."
"OK, any other drugs?","No, no other drugs."
And where do you live right now?,I live in London right now. I live with my wife in an apartment.
"OK, any reasons to think you have old carpet mold or asbestos?","No, it's a fairly new apartment."
"OK, and well those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions for me?",You don't think it could be COVID right? Like my wife got tested and it was negative.
Are you concerned about that?,"Yeah, for sure."
"Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID, especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a COVID swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours and you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics. Does that sound OK?","OK, great. Thank you."
What brings you here today?,"Um I'm here because my left hand, kind of just like at the base of my thumb, has been hurting for the past two days and it seems to be getting worse, um and I'm left handed so it's really hard for me to write or do anything um where I have to like, clench or grip things."
"OK, and how long has this been going on for?","Uhm, so for the past two days, but it's got, it got bad yesterday."
"OK, and have you had any, uh if you were to describe the pain, where is it located exactly?",It's just at the base of my thumb. Uh you know where the fleshy part of your hand is?
OK yeah yeah.,"Yeah, so just just over there."
"OK, and what kind of pain is it? Is it sharp or is it aching?","Uhm, it's it's like a um, at baseline it's an achy pain, but if I try to move it or um try to write or you know, use a computer or anything like that, it becomes sharp."
"OK, Um and on a scale of uh zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?",I'd say like a 6.
"OK, and does this pain move anywhere else in your hand, or does it just stay where you described?",Um it just stays there.
"OK, and what kind of motions uh cause the most pain?","I'd say like um you know, trying to touch my pinky with my thumb, that that hurts. Um just like trying to rotate it hurts."
"OK, um have you tried anything for the pain that has helped?","Uhm, no, I haven't really tried too much. I've just I just tried not to use it as much."
"I see. OK. And um, has this ever like, have you ever had any injuries to this hand? Any trauma either recently or in the past?","No, no, nothing like that."
"OK. Alright, and is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting um with that hand, anything repetitive?","So I do a lot of work at the computer. And um I guess I tend to type a lot with my left hand, so maybe that."
OK.,"And sorry I also take lots of notes, like handwritten notes with my left hand."
"OK, so are you left handed?",Yes.
OK. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?,No.
"No, so you're healthy?",Yes.
Um do you take any medications on a regular basis?,"Uh no, no."
"No, OK. Any allergies to any medications?",Um no allergies.
"OK, um any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?",No.
"No, any family history of any medical conditions, whether it's musculoskeletal, rheumatological, any conditions?","Uh no, nothing like that."
"OK, um any cancers in the family?","Um I know there's, yeah there's a lot of cancer in the family. There's colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer."
OK. And are they first degree relatives who had those cancers?,"Uh no first degree relatives, just like aunts and uncles."
"OK. Uh alright, and currently are you working right now or have you had any time off work or any modified duties?","Um so I'm still working online, I've just um haven't been taking notes by hand anymore."
"I see, and does that help though?",Uh yeah it it has helped a little bit because I'm not moving my hand as much so it helps with the pain.
"OK. Have you taken any uh Tylenol, Advil, anything for the pain?","No, I haven't."
"OK. Alright. And currently right now, what is your living situation like?",Uh I live in an apartment by myself.
"OK, and um, do you currently uh smoke cigarettes?","Um I smoke, I used to smoke like five years ago, and I only did that for like a year or two, um and it wasn't very much. But I don't smoke anymore."
"OK, that's good. Um any alcohol?",Um I'll have like a beer on the weekend.
OK. Any recreational drugs like marijuana?,Um I will take an edible like once a month.
"OK. Um and yeah, those were just some of the questions I had um and we're just going to do a few things for examining, examining uh that area. So are you able to make a fist?","Um I can, but it hurts."
"OK, it hurts in that location that you mentioned?",Yes.
"How about um if you make a fist without your thumb, does it still hurt or is it just when you are moving the thumb?",It's just when I'm moving the thumb.
"OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?","Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist."
Does that hurt at all?,No.
"OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm.",OK.
"And then hold your hand, sorry.","No, go ahead."
"Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb.",OK.
"Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers.",OK.
And then bring your uh arm out.,OK.
"And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground.","OK, yep."
"Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?","Yes, that is very painful."
"That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint.",OK.
"And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.",OK.
"Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.","OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."
"Welcome, take care.",You too.
How may I help you?,"Hi, yes it's nice to meet you. I've been having this cough that's been going on for the last few days and I have had difficulty breathing."
"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this start?","Oh, so the cough started about 3 days ago. Yeah, the shortness of breath has come on since then."
"OK, well let's focus on the shortness of breath first and then we'll talk about your cough as well. So you noticed that you had difficulties with breathing sometime within the past three days. When do you find that it's difficult for you to breathe? Is there anything that makes breathing more difficult for you?","Yeah, not really. Actually, it's been well, but just bad after I cough."
So say walking up the stairs or doing any exercise doesn't make it worse?,"Not really, I've been able to do the same amounts of of activity I guess."
"OK, so there's really no relationship with activity with your shortness of breath. OK, and I can see that you're able to sort of talk in full sentences.  OK, how is it making it difficult for you to do things at home, your difficulty breathing?","I am a little bit, I mean, I feel I just haven't been feeling very good overall so I've been resting these last couple of days mostly."
"OK, and your cough, you said that started three days ago. Is it a dry cough or wet cough?",It's dry. It's a dry cough.
"OK, and there's no sputum production with it? Anything coming up at all?","No, I haven't noticed anything like that."
"OK, and is there anything that's making the cough better? Did you take anything? Any medications for it?",I tried some over the counter stuff but it didn't help.
"OK alright. Other than the difficulty breathing and the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?","Yeah, I've been really tired. I guess I've just sort of been  resting the these last few days and I've had a headache as well."
OK. Can you tell me a bit more about your headache?,"Yeah, it feels like somebody is just squeezing the top of or just squeezing the sides of my head."
Have you had a headache like this before?,"I have, yeah. I usually get them when I'm dehydrated. Or maybe I haven't slept well. And that's also been the case for the past two to three days. Yeah, it's been kind of off and on, there are some times that are worse than others, but I've noticed that I had it for the most part for the last few days, OK,"
Have you taken anything for your headache? Any pain meds?,"Yeah, I've been taking some Advil, it's helped."
"And so you talked about being tired, having a headache, difficulties breathing, and coughing over the past three days. Have any of these symptoms gotten worse overtime?","Yes, I would say, but both the cough and the shortness of breath has been getting worse over these last few days."
"OK, and have you had any chills or have you checked your temperature?","I haven't checked my temperature, but I felt like I've had a fever or might be getting a fever."
We can check your temperature here. And have you had any muscle aches?,"Yeah, I guess I felt a bit achy."
Any redness in the eyes? Or any runny nose or sore throat like flu-like symptoms?,"Umm, I have, I don't know maybe my nose is a little bit congested, but not really running."
OK. And have you had any change in your sense of smell?,"No, I haven't noticed that."
What about your sense of taste? Are you able to taste things?,"Yeah, I think so."
Have you noticed any rash anywhere on your body?,"Umm, no,  I haven't."
"OK, any changes in your bowel movement, diarrhea or constipation?","No, no, nothing like that."
Any chest pain?,"No, I haven't had any."
"OK. Alright, well it sounds like you have multiple symptoms right now that started about 3 days ago. You're feeling tired, you have a headache, difficulties breathing, some muscle aches and you've been feeling feverish. You've also had this cough, and your nose is feeling congested. Is there anything else that that you've been experiencing over the past three days that I haven't talked about yet?","No, as you mentioned, the headache's there too, then yeah, that's everything."
"OK, umm, alright, can you tell me about your past medical history? Do you have any medical conditions?","Yeah, I have asthma and GERD I think."
"Umm, does the shortness of breath that you're experiencing feel similar to the asthma attacks in any way?","No, I haven't had any issues with like asthma attacks in a long time."
Do you have an inhaler?,I do but I don't use it very often.
"I see, did you use it over the past three days at all?",Yeah I did try it and it didn't really seem to help that much.
"Uh, and other than that, have you had any any surgeries in the past?","Uh, I had a colonoscopy two years ago."
Any reason for that?,"Uhh, my father had colon cancer when he was in his 60s."
"I see OK, and any hospitalizations?",No.
"OK. Do you take any medications? I know you have puffers. Any medications, including over the counter pills?","Yeah, I'll take like a Zantac or like Tums sometimes for reflux."
"And, uh, any allergies to food, medications, or environmental allergies?","Yeah, I have environmental allergies. I think like usually they come on in the springtime."
"In terms of family histories, you did mention that your dad had colon cancer. Any other medical problems that that run in your family?","Umm, no."
OK. And do you currently smoke?,"No, I don't and have never smoked in the past."
"OK, what about marijuana?","Umm, no."
"OK, do you or have you ever had alcohol?","I will have some wine on the weekends, maybe a glass or two with dinner."
"OK, sounds good and have you ever had any street drugs?","Like a long time ago, maybe when I was in college, once or twice."
"Alright, sounds good, and have you had any contact with any sick people? Anyone who's sick recently?","Not that I know of. I mean, I went to a few stores here and there that I had been going to. I've been working from home so maybe at one of the stores. And I would imagine I were wearing a mask and of course trying to maintain social distancing as much as possible. But yeah, you never, really know."
What about any other travels or any travels at all outside the city or the country recently?,"Umm, no, I had been at home."
Alright. So I guess that's all I wanted to know. I'll go talk to the attending and we'll come back and do a physical exam and maybe ask a couple more questions and then discuss the management with you. Does that sound good to you?,"Yeah, that sounds great."
What brings you all in today?,"Essentially, when he, so today is Friday, when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he, I don't know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick, so he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Um and then, yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, or sorry it's today, today is Friday, um, he was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today. What was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember. It was it was, it was like over 100 though."
Oh OK.,"101 or something or maybe 100.1. But anyways, it was, so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know thought he could have maybe got COVID and get school or something."
"Yeah for sure. Um, OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five 5 days.",Mhmm.
"OK. OK, so let's focus on the cough.","Sorry, it's been more like 3 three days like Wednesday is when he came home and then, and then today's Friday, so yeah, sorry."
"Today is Friday, OK. Um, OK, yeah sure. So, is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?","Ah I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like spitting up anything. Umm, yeah, he yeah, it's just been like little coughs."
"OK, and he, is he, he's not bringing up any sputum or blood?",No.
"No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?","No, no, not that I've noticed."
"OK, how about short of breath?","Um, I don't think so like he, usually he's a really active kid and he has, he hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing but also I think he's just been tired in general."
"OK, yeah. OK, and is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night in the morning?",I think it kinda just there the whole day.
"OK um. And does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Um, like harsh, what is, what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?","Uh, I just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud."
"OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?","I don't like he's had colds before, but I haven't like, I haven't like you, this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold."
OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?,"I think so. Because yeah, he first day he just seemed like little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever."
"OK, and um, is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?","No, I don't think so."
No OK. Does he have a sore throat?,I don't think so.
"OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?","I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now."
"OK, um, and is he, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?",Maybe a bit of like a runny nose.
"OK, and does he have any issues with smell or taste?","Ah, this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit."

"OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?",No.
"OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?","No, I haven't noticed anything like that."
"OK, any changes in his bowel movements?","Uh, no."

Any dizziness or fainting spells?,"No, just like fatigue."
"OK, any confusion or memory loss?",No.
"And is he an, is he an otherwise healthy child?","Yeah, absolutely, he hasn't like decide to like vaccines, he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever. I mean, he broke his arm once but that was it."
"OK, so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm?","Exactly, like nothing."
OK and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?,Yeah totally
"OK. Ah, and then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?","No, no, like everything was things really good."
OK and then did he hit all his milestones? Up till now?,Yeah totally

"OK an any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?",No.
"No OK, um has he been around any sick contacts recently?","Not not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school but he goes to school right now so kind of hard to say. They haven't like contacted us about anything."
"OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?",No.
"No, OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?","I don't think so. Like I realized that I can often times like we don't really do much for kids when you know, when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess, need to have a COVID test to go back to school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say it's like the other kids have had uh an exposure."
Mhmm.,"So yeah yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead."
No go ahead.,"So I just wanted to basically see if it was that and I mean he does receive you're so scared. That's kind of what made me come in, like it's scaring me a little bit."
"Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a COVID swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. If his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and uhm, so for now I'll just wait for those COVID swabs to come back. How does that sound?","Yeah, sounds good."
OK great.,Thank you.
"Yeah, no worries. Uhm and I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add everything's like asthma to the list of things",

We'll do a physical exam, see, just listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth and check your temperature and go from there. It sounds like you probably have a viral infection of some sort that should get, hopefully get better over time. We will also get a covid swab done just in case and if things seem to get worse, we can, you can definitely come back.","OK, great, thank you."

And so we'll order a chest X-ray, some blood gases and do a sputum culture and possibly start antibiotics, but, depending on the severity we may not not need to just yet. And then we'll also use some inhalers as well as inhaled steroid to help with the inflammation in the airways.",Sure.
"Alright, we'll get that started.",Thank you.
What can I do for you?,"So I've been, just over the last week, I've been feeling pretty sick.

"I see, and have you been wearing a mask?","Yeah, well I try to wear the mask. Sometimes like uh, in the, in the stock, like lounge, we like take take off the mask to eat and stuff but that's about it."
Are you maintaining social distancing when you're taking your mask off?,"Yeah, it's uh, most of the times we're pretty socially distanced when we're eating, but sometimes it's like hard to control when you know, when you're going near the microwave to heat up your food, and sometimes it gets hard. It's a, it's a fairly small room, so."
"Yeah, well I would, I would recommend that you try to eat when people are not in the room if possible because you are putting yourself at risk.  Like if it's a small room, I think you should also talk to management or try to limit the number of people who can be in the room at a time. Um, for your own safety, you know, and for the safety of others uh, working with you. Um okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere recently?","No, we've been uh, at home."

"We will also get a COVID swab done, simply because your symptoms sound very similar to um, or I guess a lot of these symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID, so we'll do that. And um, I would require, would request that you continue to uh, stay at home if you haven't been doing so so far. Um, take a leave from work, try to do work from home, and quarantine at home as much as possible and stay away from your wife and your daughter as well, at least until the swab is back and you get some more guidance from uh, public health. If it is positive, they will give you a call. Um, there are lots of guidelines on how to self isolate and I, I can share that with you. Um, it's best that you do that for now.

"Okay, and um, what does the cough sound like? Is it like a harsh cough, a barky cough?","Um, it's just, she just makes this noise when she's like breathe, trying to take a breath in. It's, it's yeah."

It was just uh, watery, uh, since discharge. And at that time her cough, she had a cough as well. Um, but I thought it was, you know, it's nothing. It was just like another flu and it would get better, but then she just, the runny nose got better without, in a couple of days, but the cough stayed. And it got, got pretty worse, uh, it got worse."
"Okay, um, other than the cough uh, any, any fevers or chills?","No, I don't think she's had fevers. I haven't checked, though."

Okay. And is there anything that has helped her at all? Like any over the counter medications or anything like that?,"I haven't tried anything, I'm just worried about, you know she's my first child and I don't know what to give her and what not to give her at this age.

"Okay. And in terms of her milestones, has she been meeting all of them on time?",Yes.
"Okay. Alright, so I think those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?","Uh, no."
"Yeah, so based on the symptoms, oh yeah, sorry I forgot to ask one other question. Has she, are her immunizations all up to date?","Oh no, no. I don't, I don't get those. My friend's, my friend's daughter developed autism and I'm just, I don't want that, you know, so no. I don't vaccinate my kids. Or I don't vaccinate my daughter and I haven't been. Yeah, uh no, I won't be doing that."
And have you been vaccinated throughout your life?,"Um, maybe when I was young, but I, yeah I don't, I just don't believe in vaccinations. I, yeah, no, I don't, I don't get those."
"Yeah, so there is definitely uh, there's a lot of research done beside, behind vaccinations and a lot of prevention goes into them, but definitely there is some anecdotal evidence of very loose associations to autism that have been found to be invalid and like they have been invalidated by the research. So definitely, it's very important to get your child vaccinated. In fact, the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis, and um, there's usually a vaccination for that. Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well. And usually it, she's currently in the, it seems to be the second phase, where she's vomiting and coughing a lot, and then it usually, after that phase, two or three more weeks of just coughing. And so, we're going to do some supportive care for her right now, but yeah, definitely, you should consider vaccinating your child. We recommend that to every parent as there's a lot of diseases out there that can be completely prevented if you vaccinate your child.","Okay, I'll think about it."
"Alright, so, so for now we're gonna just make sure that she's doing well, okay?",Sure.
How may I help you?,"Hi, um, I'm here because I, I had this cough for a couple days and now my voice still hasn't recovered. It sounds really hoarse and I can't speak as well, so I was just wondering if you can give me something for that."
"Possibly we will see just gotta ask a few questions first, and we'll, we'll do a physical exam as well afterwards, but certainly, we'll look into what is causing your symptoms. So you mentioned a cough. When did that exactly start?",That started three days ago.
"Okay, and have you had a cough before?","Um, like before the three days you mean?"
Yeah.,"Um, no, I was pretty healthy before then."
"I see and uh, with the cough, are you producing any phlegm or sputum?","No, it's pretty dry."
"Okay, have you noticed any blood?",No.
"Alright, and have you had a wheeze?","No, uh, no, nothing like that."

"Yeah, so uh, right now it's sounding like um, a viral type illness where there's inflammation of the vocal cords, uh, with having the cough and the runny nose a couple of days ago. Actually, this reminds me that. Have you, I'm not sure if I asked about fevers or chills, if you have any?","Uh no, I haven't."
"Okay, um, and so for, if it is a viral infection then, um, it's just supportive kind of management. So that will mean trying to stay as hydrated as you possibly can over these next um, next few days and then also you can use things like, if they help, like lozenges or something along those lines. Um, but it will, it will just take some time for it to come back on its own, a few days to a couple of weeks sometimes. And the cough could possibly last for um, two to four weeks after um, after having a viral type illness.",Okay.
"Yeah, so it could be quite a few weeks that the symptoms last for. But since you're having a cough, and these symptoms could overlap with COVID we'll want to get a COVID swab today as well um, and kind of go from there.","Okay. Okay, that sounds good, thank you."

"Well, it's really great that you're, you know, trying to lose weight and dieting and and having like a healthier lifestyle. It is definitely harder with the pandemic going on right now to to get in the activities. And it's hard like being at home, and sometimes it's really difficult to like not eat right",Yeah yeah true.
"So besides besides that any kind of recent exposures to any fumes, dust, animals, pets like anything like that?","Yeah, it was kind of like vacuuming a couple of days ago when it got really bad, but nothing. Not not. I don't think there's not been any other exposures."
"OK. And do you have any past medical conditions that you have been diagnosed with like asthma, eczema, anything like that?","I haven't been diagnosed with anything. No. I did have like I know that I would sometimes get kind of short of breath as a child. But my mom doesn't really trust doctors, so she wouldn't take me to one."
"OK, have you had shortness of breath after that, like when like as a child, how old were you?","I must have been like 8 years old or 9 years old that I remember, but I think I've had it before that as well as my mom tells me."

"Yeah, it must be very frustrating. So you've tried Reactin before, right?",yeah
"Yeah, so one method is to definitely like stay away from some of those allergens that are potentially causing your symptoms. But I I do really think so you might have something called like allergic rhinitis. And I think it might be beneficial to for you to see like an allergist",sure.
"And so I can refer you to someone as well. Just have a sense of what kind of things allergic to you and like what medications you would require. In the meantime, definitely like any antihistamine medications would help with your symptoms. But since you're also having congestion and sneezing, just just in case, we will just do a COVID swab test for you today. And it takes around 24 to 48 hours to come back. And in the meantime, you should just isolate as much as you can in your own home. And then based on the result they would give you more instruction.",Sure

"Yeah, it sounds like you have some sort of infection, so the first thing we need to rule out is covid, of course. So we'll do a swab and those swabs should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours and until then, it's important that you do isolate and you isolate for 14 days at least, and that includes from other people at home. And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out. And, so that's where we'll start for now, because your presentation is acute, we think it's likely infection related.","OK, that sounds good to me and should I be staying in my own room or anything like that at home?"
"Yeah, if you can like, it's recommended that you try to isolate in your own room for the next 14 days because your symptoms do overlap with that of covid, yeah.","OK, sounds good.Thank you."

Any recreational drugs like marijuana?,No.
"No, OK, alright, so those are all the questions we had. Do you have any questions or concerns?","No, what do you think I have and is there anything I need to do right now?"
"Yeah, So what, uh, some of your symptoms are concerning, especially the coughing up blood, which is something that we always think of with tuberculosis. You don't have any history of, uh, family history of lung cancer or anything like that, so right now, especially since you just moved from India where tuberclosis is endemic, we need to make sure that we test you for tuberculosis. In the meantime though, you will need to stay in the hospital and be in an isolated room, uh, where we can filter some of the air and make sure, it's a very infective condition if you do have it so while you're getting all the tests done, you will need to stay here in an isolated room. Also, we will get some sputum smears and cultures to test for TB and we will also, I will need to, if the test comes back positive we will need to contact public health and let your contacts know as well. Lastly, we will also be getting, since you're having the hemoptysis, like coughing up blood, we will, we might also do a chest X-ray to see if",

"Okay, um, yeah, we, so um, the first thing we will want to get uh, an x-ray um, of the knee and also of the uh, long bones, so of your femur um, as well as your leg too.

"OK, and then for your uh COPD, which inhalers are you on?","Uh, there's one that's for, um, like short acting. And then there's one that I use everyday, uh Spiriva, I think."
"OK, yeah. And how long have you been on these inhalers?","Uh it's been a couple of years for well, for the the short one that I I use for rescue therapies been for like a long time, but Spiriva's been the last several years."

"I was just bringing my son and he's just had cough for the last couple of days. I thought about a day and a half ago, it doesn't feel like a cold. He hasn't been too sick, but I was a little bit worried and I wanted to get him seen to see if there's anything we could do.","Yeah, for sure. It's a good thing that you brought him in. So the cough, is it consistent? Or does it come and go?"
"It seems to be a little bit worse at night. He'll have this cough during the day. Sometimes I'll notice when he's playing. He's had these coughing fits that last for up to a minute but usually recovers from. He hasn't been too active to be honest. He's been a little bit slowed down these last couple of days, but in regards to consistency, I'd say it's a little bit worse at night.","OK, any other triggers like dust or the cold air? Anything like that?"
"I haven't really noticed anything. We've been mainly keeping inside due to covid, right? I think my wife left a window open the other night, and maybe the cough was a little bit better. I'm not sure. It's kind of hard to tell when we sleep.","Yeah, have you tried anything for it, like have you given him any over the counter cough medications?"
"No, we're a little scared to give him anything. He's so young. He's 2 1/2. We haven't been really giving him any medications to be honest.","OK, good. And if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's barky? Is it harsh?"
"Barky might be a good word to describe it, like he's had colds before his coughs were quiet but this sounds harsh. It sounds like he's really trying to cough hard there. Very violent sometimes.",OK OK. And has he ever had a cough like this in the past?
"No, never.","OK, and then in terms of the timeline, is it getting worse? His cough?"
"I think it has been to be honest. He was a little ill like he had a runny nose a couple of days ago, maybe two days ago and then the cough started but it only really started getting noticeably different about the night of the first day, about two days ago so. Now it's been more present I suppose,than it was when he just first had it.","OK, and is it a dry cough or does he bring up sputum?"
"Sputum like phlegm,no he doesn't bring anything up really, so dry.",OK so no blood as well right?
No blood.,"OK,  does he have any shortness of breath with his cough?"
"I feel like when he has the coughing fits, he's winded. He's weak after them. Sometimes he cries after them or before the middle can be a trigger for it, but just resting normally, he doesn't seem that out of breath, no.",OK any wheeziness?
"No, not really. He's able to breathe. I can't really hear him breathing that much. Sometimes at night after a bad cough he'll be really winded. And yeah, it does sound like a little different when he's breathing, but just right now he sounds normal.","OK, and any reason for you to think he has chest pain?"
" He hasn't any sort of chest pain. He says his throat hurts, but I don't think it's his chest.",Has he had any fevers?
P No.,"Any change in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?"
"No, no rashes.",How about weight loss?
"No weight loss, he's a fairly healthy kid.", And his vision and hearing are normal?
"You know, I haven't gotten him formally assessed yet, but seems to be able to read pretty well from a distance. He's not in school yet, but I haven't noticed anything, and he can hear fine. I think he responds when I call.","OK, has he had a stuffy or runny nose?"
"Yeah yeah, that's kind of how it first started three days ago. Maybe had a runny nose. OK, yeah.",Does he still have a runny nose?
"Umm, a little bit less now. No, not as much now.","OK. And his taste, any reason to believe there are any changes there?"
"Well, we've been kind of spoiling him a bit, just giving him ice cream. His throat hurts a little bit and he seems to still like it, so it's hard to tell.","OK, so he has a little bit of a sore throat as well?"
Yeah.,"OK OK, and then any dizziness or fainting spells that you've noticed?"
"No fainting or dizzy spells, but he's really gassed after he has like a coughing fit and he doesn't want to stand up, he'll just be sitting down or he wants to be held.","OK, is he more irritable than usual?"
"Yeah after he has a bad coughing fit, he wants to be soothed and he'll be crying, but it's just more of because he's worn out, I believe he's tired.","Yeah, OK, and then any confusion or memory loss?"
No.,"OK, and then in terms of his bowel movements, have things been normal from that standpoint?"
"Oh yeah, process of potty training him, but no, no real changes.","OK, so no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?"
No., OK and he's passing gas?
OK yeah I'd say so.,Any nausea or vomiting?
"No. We haven't been really feeding him solid meals, it's because he's been sick, we've been trying to give him soup and liquids for the most part because his throat hurts, but he's able to keep them down. So no, no nausea, no vomiting.","OK, and then how about changes in his appetite?"
"Yeah, he's not eating as much but still, we're trying to force food into him to keep his energy up. Most of time he always will be asking for snacks in the afternoon, but now not so much.",OK. Alright and any anything else that I missed that he's been experiencing over the past few days?
"No, just the cough.","OK, and then he otherwise healthy? Does he have any longstanding medical conditions?"
"No longstanding medical conditions. Yeah, nothing really. We had a little bit of stay in the NICU, just because he was a little bit underweight, but no, nothing really.",OK. And then his mother's pregnancy with him? Any complications at that point?
Yeah he's a little pre term. 34 weeks I think.,"OK, was he also underweight too?  You mentioned just a little bit."
Yeah.,"OK, and any complications during the actual delivery?"
"Yeah, not that I remember like she started going to labor early, like earlier than we expected. We thought it was just a regular contraction and that it will just resolve but she wound up proceeding when we showed up at the hospital","OK and then in terms of growth, weight and head circumference, has he been hitting all those milestones for the past 2 1/2 years?"
"Yeah, we we bring him to the family doctor every couple of month for his regular checkups and nothing has been brought up to be concerning for his vaccines. He has been doing well.","OK and then how about other milestones like speech, movement, fine movement, all of that, like have those been normal? Is he on par with his peers?"
"Yeah, this is our first kid, but compared to his cousins he seems to be doing well. He's speaking, he's got little sentences, now he has good eye contact. He's a good kid.","OK, good good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries aside from when he was born?"
No no.,OK good and is he on any medications?
"No, OK we give him like a flintstone gummy.","OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?"
Yeah.,Any allergies?
Not that we know of.,Any family history of lung conditions?
"So my grandfather, so his greatgrandfather I suppose passed away from lung cancer. He was a heavy smoker though. On my mom's side there's some breast cancer. No,  nothing really that comes to mind for lungs.",And any heart conditions?
"No, not that we know of.",And how about other cancers?
"No, not that I know of.","OK, how about asthma, eczema or allergies in the family?"
"You know, I think my sister is allergic to peas, but she was never sick from them like go to the hospital.  I don't think there are any allergies in the family.","OK, good, has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"
"You know, like 5 days ago we had a playdate with his cousin. And we kind of thought that that's where he got the cold from. Like the runny nose, but it just turned weird, you know.",OK and how's this cousin doing?
"Last time I talked to Charlotte, Hank seems to be doing well so.","Alright, and has he traveled to anywhere recently? Have you any of you traveled anywhere recently?"
"No, with covid and everything, we have just been keeping to ourselves.",And with who and where does he live?
He lives with me and his mother in a house,OK. Any old carpets or mold or concerns for asbestos? Anything like that at home?
I don't know when this house is built. I don't think there's any asbestos in it and it's all hardwood. So no.,"OK, good. Anyone at home smoke?"
"No, no.","OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had. Do you have any questions for me?"
"No, no that's it, no.","OK, well, from the sounds of it, he most likely has some sort of viral infection. We will do a COVID swap to rule that out because some symptoms do seem to overlap with COVID and we want to make sure to rule that out. So we'll take a swab. Those PCR results should come back in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, he should isolate for 14 days at home and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection like parainfluenza, also known as croup. So for that, for any of these viral infections, actually the best treatment is to stay at home and make sure that he's very well hydrated and eating well. If his symptoms persist for three to five days or more, or if his symptoms worsen, especially if he has like a seizure or urological issues, he should go to the ER and if his symptoms do become worse, we can also prescribe him some steroids or epinephrine just to open up his airways. And if it's really, really bad he might be hospitalised as well. So just keep an eye on on that for now. And if you have any"
Would you mind by starting to tell me what brought you in?,"Sure, my 5 year old daughter, I noticed that she's been coughing a lot over the past two days. She sounds like she has a stuffy nose and now she's got this pink eye so I just wanted to get it checked out by you."

"OK, so the main symptoms are the cough that started two days ago and also you've noticed she's been congested. And sorry, what was the last symptom?",She has this pink eye and she has a cough.
"Yeah, right, that could be conjunctivitis. OK, so at this point we will certainly run some investigations to look into what this could be. It sounds like a viral infectious type of process, especially if it's involving the eyes, nose, and and with a cough. And so we will test with a swab for covid for sure. But it could be something more common, like the common cold. We just need to make sure that we're comprehensive in that with the testing.","That sounds great, thank you."
What brings you in?,I've had this cough that started four days ago uh that that's been getting worse and um just started having some some diarrhea yesterday as well.

"Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. We'll do like a full physical examination, take a look at your knee, um, and most likely, what this sounds like, is something called septic arthritis. It's uh, it's when there's like an infection that um, can go into your joints and uh, it is a pretty serious issue that we need to um, assess and treat as soon as possible. So the first thing that we will um, need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your uh, CBC, and see if you have um, an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away um, today, and so you will be um, here for a while until we get all those results back. And you may also require um, an admission today as well.","Okay, uh, thank you. Yeah, that, that sounds good."

"OK, and is there anything that you have tried that has helped you with these symptoms? Any over the counter medications?","No, I haven't tried anything. I've been thinking about using some nasal decongestion but I don't want to make my runny nose any worse."
"Yeah, no, that's a, that's a fair point. And yeah, there's multiple things that you can try over the counter, but we can get into that more later. Are you having any other symptoms at all, like any, shortness of breath, chest pain, any kind of dizziness, anything like that?","No dizziness, I feel like sometimes I have a headache though, because I feel like there's a lot of fluid or something backed up into my sinuses."
"OK, so do you, are you feeling, that pressure in your face at all?","Mhm, a little bit, yeah."
OK. Have you at all in the past couple weeks to a month had contact with anyone that was sick?,"No, nothing like that, that I can think of."
OK and any travel?,"Uhm, no."
"OK, and any symptoms of a loss of taste of, sorry, loss of sense of taste or smell?",No.
"No, any nausea or vomiting?","Uh, nope."
Any night sweats?,No.

"OK. And yeah, those are pretty much all the questions I have right now. Do you have any questions?","Uh, no, what can I do about this runny nose?"
"Yeah, so it seems like it's been going on for more than one and a half week. What, what is reassuring is that you're not having any other symptoms that are concerning, like you're not having any cough, you're not having any green or yellow sputum, you're not having any fevers, so it seems that you might just be having a cold, which can be caused by just a viral, uh, infection, but it should go away on its own. Just make sure that you're getting some rest, you're hydrating well, uhm, you can get some over the counter medications like Tylenol cold for example, but for now I would say we should just wait and watch. But just in case, also, since it is one of the symptoms that's for covid as well, in this time period we will just get a covid swab just in case, but most likely it's nothing to be worried about. Until you get your test, I would recommend staying isolated. And then we can go on from there, is that, does that sound good to you?","Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much."
"You're welcome, take care.",You too.
What brings you in?,"Yeah, so I just brought my son, went to the hospital.

"OK, so all of this started a day ago, you mentioned?","Yeah, it started yesterday, but the grunting started today, like, I think he was a bit on the warmer side last night as well, more irritable last night, but the grunting started this morning."
"OK, Uhm, and you mentioned his fever was 38, correct?","Yeah, I think it was like 38, 7 or something like that."
OK is he coughing at all?,"Uhm, yeah, I would say with the grunting there is some coughing in between as well."
"OK, and is he bringing up any phlegm?","Uhm, he's been having some spit ups as well. They're mainly like clear and whitish, but yeah I don't know if he's bringing anything else up. There's no green or yellow material though."
"OK, any blood in there?","No, I haven't notice any blood."
Does he sound wheezy?,"Uh no, it's mainly just the grunting."
"OK, OK, does he look swollen to you?","Uh, swollen as in just, uh, like in his."
"In his, uh, like uh, legs, arms or belly area.","No, I don't think so."
"No ok, and uh, does he have a runny nose or a stuffy nose?","No, I don't think so."
"No, OK, how is his feeding?","Yeah, it's it's been difficult. So right now, like his mom is at home, but she was having difficulty feeding. He's mainly breastfed right now."
OK.,And he's not really been feeding too much either.
"OK, and how about like the number of wet diapers he has?","Just the normal like, that hasn't changed. He has like three or four in a day."
"OK, OK, good. Have you noticed any changes to his bowel movements or urine?","No, pretty much been the same."
"OK, is he throwing up at all?","Nope, just some spit ups, I don't know if that's, Just because of the coughing or if they're just spit ups, like, but nothing after eating."
"OK, OK, have you noticed any rashes on him?","No, no rashes."
"OK, uhm, has he had any fainting spells or seizures?","Uh, no, I've been really trying to make sure, like, I was worried if he gets blue or something that we would rush to the emergency department, but I haven't noticed anything like that."
"OK, OK good. Has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?","No, I don't think so. We've been trying to be very careful with the pandemic and everything going on."
"For sure, any travel to anywhere recently?",No.
"OK, and is he an other-wise healthy baby?","Yeah, so, uh, healthy but he was born premature at 36 weeks."
OK.,"And no complications really with the pregnancy or after he was born. But yeah, he was premature."
"OK, and so he didn't need any hospitalizations right after birth, right?","No, he was fine after birth."

"OK, and does anyone at home smoke?",Nope.
"OK, well, those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?","Yeah, no, I was just really worried like, the grunting is just really scaring us. So do you, I was just wondering if you know what it could be."
"Yeah, so the grunting is worrisome. He could have anything from bronchiolitis to pneumonia so what we'll do is, we'll, first get his temperature, we'll get his O2 sat and we will get some imaging done as well to see if it's more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. If it's bronchiolitis, it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we'll keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen. And if it's pneumonia, we'll prescribe him some antibiotics. How does that sound?","Yeah, and will he need to stay in the hospital at all?"
"Yeah so for now, because, if he is in any distress and if he needs oxygen, and IV hydration, he'll need to stay in the hospital until he's better from that standpoint. I should also mention, we should do a covid swab on him as well because his symptoms are in line with covid as well, so we'll have to do that to rule it out.","OK, yeah, that sounds good, Uh, uh, yeah, thank you so much."
What brings you here today?,"Hi I am having difficulties breathing and I've just had this cough and it's, It's been two months now."

OK. So an are your symptoms just constant over the last two months or do they come and go?,Shortness of breath just kind of stays.
"OK, and is there anything that helps with your shortness of breath, like taking a rest or any positions in particular?","Yeah, sometimes resting does help. I find that it's worse when I'm moving around, I'm huffing and puffing more."
"OK, and is it worse at all when you lay down?",No.
No? And do you find yourself ever having to wake up at night and gasp gasping for air?,"No, it hasn't gotten that far but seeing how bad it's been over the past two months and how fast is progressing, I won't be surprised if I can't even sleep. It's been quite difficult I I don't even know why I waited so long. I should have come in earlier."
"Well, I'm glad you came in today. We can definitely try and help you with what's going on. Do you at all use any kind of medications to help you with your symptoms?",I've just been using my inhalers a bit more but they don't always help.

"For sure, so, um, we will first get your vitals here and we'll see if your oxygen levels um, are low, then it would be important to put on some oxygen first, um, just to make sure that that's stable. Um, and from there we will um, get a chest x-ray um, and uh, run some lab work to, to try to help figure out the, the diagnosis better, but in the meantime, we'll use um, some inhalers because it's possible that this is a COPD exacerbation similar to uh last year, um, and the inhalers should help open up the airways and dilate, so make breathing easier, and then um, also if it is a COPD exacerbation, it will likely require antibiotics, as well as some steroids for the, the inflammation for five days. Uh, but since your symptoms currently overlap with uh, COVID as well, you'll have to get a, a COVID nasal swab.","Okay, okay for sure."

It's changed 'cause it used to be stuffy, now it's more of a runny nose. Um but yeah, it seems to be runny, like it's the same amount of runniness for the past couple of days."
And are you having any symptoms of loss of smell at all?,"No, no loss of smell."

"OK. Um yeah, so those were some of the questions I had for you. I know it's a bit concerning because of the pandemic going on and um a runny nose can be a symptom uh of Covid as well, but uh it can also be a symptom of just the common cold or any other virus. Um but since you're having, uh you're symptomatic right now, we will definitely get like a Covid swab test done for you.",OK.
"And if you start having any, just monitor for your symptoms. Um you should have the test back within 48 hours. Until then, uh at least for 14 days you should try to isolate in your own room, wear a mask around uh your partner, uh and not go outside, so just self isolate.",OK.

What do you do to make it go away?","Uh, I just basically have to, if I, if I'm doing any kind of activities, just take a moment, sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own."
And you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it?,"Yeah, like a couple of times it got really bad where I had to um like, it was difficult get, it was, it was like I was trying to take deep breaths for air, but uh it was, it just felt like I couldn't."

"Okay, okay. Just wanted to mention that the conversation that we're having right now is confidential between you and me. Um, unless you mentioned anything that harms you or harms anyone else so, so feel free to discuss whatever or talk openly about um, any issues that you have. Um, okay, and um, are you sexually active?","No, no."
"Alright, okay. So um, that's all the information I needed. Uh given that you've had these coughing fits for the past couple of months that are, that have certain triggers, uh, and also given that you've had a history of eczema, and your sister has asthma, so kind of, sort of runs in your family in a way. You might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially. Um, and so, what I would recommend is that you get um, testing done and um, uh I guess before I sort of talk a little more about this, I just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma, if it's asthma at all, um if, does it, does it affect your ability to, you said school was going okay, does it affect your ability to do well at school at all?","Um definitely in, in gym class, but other than that it hasn't really affected me."

"Okay, okay. Um, and how often, I guess is, do these episodes occur? How many times a week, or how many times a month?","Uh, so they just started like two months ago, and I've had like maybe four or five of them in total."
"Okay, okay. Uh, and they kind of get better on their own. Okay, so we can sort of talk about these, sorry, puffers that you might need to, to use as needed. Um, your sister might have some of those, so you might be familiar with what I'm talking about.",Yeah.
"Um, so we can talk about that. Um, given that your symptoms are, yes, they've been occurring for the past couple of months, but because you have had a cough, it might be a good idea just to have a COVID test done once. Um, I don't think that's what you have, seeing that this, these symptoms have been lasting for, have been occurring for the past two months, so we'll just kind of do that test to rule it out. Um, in the meantime, I would recommend that you um, try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use, that you should use on a daily basis, and try to avoid uh, the triggers. So the things that you, that cause these symptoms. Um, we can go over how to use uh, a puffer properly and I will also give you a spacer, which will help deliver most of that medication in the, uh, to your lungs. Do you have any questions?","Uh no, I don't have any questions at all. Thank you so much."
What brings you in?,"Yeah, I've had uh, a cough that's been um, bugging me for the last several months now, and more recently I've noticed that I've started to bring up a bit more, or a little bit of blood as well."
"Okay, well that's not good. So you said the cough started several months ago, how many months ago do you think, like three, four, five?","Uh, yeah I would say, yeah, maybe like, like five or six, and it kind of started um, it was really infrequent and so it didn't really, well I thought it was just the usual smoking, but it's been getting worse over these last, over these past six months."
"Okay and um, the blood in the cough, when did that start?","So that started about, uh, about two weeks ago."
"Two weeks ago, okay. Um, how much blood are you coughing up like, if uh, like is it the size of your palm, is it more than that, less than that?","Uh, I would say less than that, like each time there's maybe to about the size of I don't know, uh, like a looney. So like inside of the palm."
"Okay, sure. Um, and are you experiencing any shortness of breath along with your cough?","Yeah, now that you mention it, I have been. It's uh, you know, I thought that was just kind of me getting older and the smoking, but I've certainly been able, I haven't been able to walk as far and even uh, to the end of the driveway getting the mail now is, is pretty, I'll get short of breath. Before I used to be able to walk a lot further than that, just a couple of years ago."
"Yeah, for sure. Um, and sorry you said, you mentioned, you mentioned you had some wheezing as well, right?","Um, I haven't really had any, noticed any wheezing."

"Yeah, for sure. Um, so they're a couple of things we're gonna work you up for. Um, because some of your symptoms overlap with COVID, we'll start by getting a COVID swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um, we will also do a chest x-ray um, to look for any signs of lung cancer. Um, and then if we see consolidation or anything that would indicate um, like a mass in your lungs, we will discuss options for like biopsies which is the gold standard for diagnosing lung cancers. Also, I know you haven't had any recent travel or anything like that and your symptoms have been going on for a long time, but uh, it may also be worthwhile to uh, also check for things like TB, which could also cause you to cough up blood. Um, so we'll start, we'll start from there, and then if those come back negative, then we'll work you up further for other things that you may have, but are like more rare. How does that sound?",That sounds like a good plan. Thank you.

It's possible that while you were drunk that you might have, and given that you have acid reflux, that you might have accidentally have something go inside your breathing tube from, from your mouth or something that came up from your stomach and sometimes when that happens, food items can or other things can get lodged in your lungs and can become, uhm, can attract bacteria to, uh, to replicate and cause a bacterial infection, so it's possible that, that's what happened But it could also be a viral pneumonia or a viral infection in your chest. we'll get a chest x-ray done, we'll have some labs done as well, and we'll likely start some antibiotics.

"Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics.

"Yeah, certainly so umm, it, it sounds like it could be maybe a viral infection that I brought on this cough and worsen the sputum. This could be a bacterial infection, it could be a COPD exacerbation and also one of the other things that we would have to consider right now is Covid as well and so we will do a PCR nasal swab for Covid and a chest Xx-ray and some other investigations as well and uhm, we will try to get to the bottom of what's causing your your shortness of breath.","OK, that sounds good, thank you."

"No, not particularly.","No, OK. How about any changes to your hearing or vision?"
No.,"No, how about changes in smell or taste?"
"Uh, no, that's like a Covid thing, right? Like I was hoping because I could still, I could still like taste my coffee this morning, I was hoping that that means I don't have Covid, but yeah, I don't really know.","I mean yeah, some people have it, some people don't.

Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods.

"OK, so dorsiflexion is limited. And how about pushing your foot down like you're pressing on the gas pedal?","I can do that, but it's still painful just to move the ankle."
"OK, so planter flexion is is painful as well. And then any issues with moving your toes?",No.
"OK, and then you mentioned that with walking you're having a limp currently?",Yes.
"OK, so we have an antalgic gates with an inability to bear weight as well. OK, so the that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today and based on these features it is starting like it could be either an ankle fracture or an ankle sprain. But because of the pin-point tenderness or that you're finding on the lateral side as well as some of the the inability to bear weight as you're describing it'll be important to get an X-Ray to make sure that there's not a fracture. Um and yeah, and if there is then it will be important to have some sort of air boot or casting so that to make sure that we're offloading the area for the bones to heal, but we'll see what the X-Ray shows.","OK, that sounds great, thank you."
What brings you in?,"Yeah, so I just came in today, I actually had asthma as a kid and I used to be on the puffers and it pretty much resolved by the time I was around like 18 years old, and I've been pretty good since then. I haven't even been really using the puffers for the last five years, but just recently, just during the winter I started noticing some of my symptoms coming back and now, especially over the last few months whenever I'm doing something like going to the gym or exercising, I do get that shortness of breath and I feel my throat closing in again and recently for the last, I would say a week I've also been having some wheezing as well. So yeah, I just wanted to come back and make sure everything is alright."
"OK sure, so just to rewind a little bit. When were you first diagnosed with asthma?","So I was diagnosed when I was, I think it was like when I was 13 years old."
"13, OK, and you've been using Puffers since?","Yeah so from then to like maybe when I was 18 I was using Puffers, and then I continued using them on and off like, just the blue one whenever I needed it. But for the last five years, I haven't even had to use any puffers at all."
"OK, OK. So can you tell me a little bit about the symptoms that you're experiencing right now? OK, so you said some shortness of breath, when did that start?","So yeah, in the last, I would say two months I've noticed it, similarly to when I was younger, especially when I'm on the treadmill or running, I get short of breath very easily. But at rest I'm fine, I don't have any trouble, but I've noticed it for the last few months."
"OK, so it's mostly when you're exercising or with activities?",Mhm.
OK. And do you feel wheezy as well?,"Yeah, in the last one to two weeks I would say I'm also wheezing as well. Mainly during like, if I'm running or still, with exercise, I feel myself wheezing. Yeah, so that's been an issue for the last couple of weeks."
"So once you stop activity, does your shortness of breath and wheezing eventually resolve?","Yeah, yeah, so I just have to kind of sit down and relax for a bit and then it goes away on its own."
"OK, how long does it last before it goes away?","Probably, at least, like I would say 10 to 15 minutes."
"OK, OK.",Until I'm fully kind of recovered.
"Ok, Ok. Are You coughing as well?","Uhm, yeah, when I'm exercising, that's when all of that happens. The wheezing, the coughing, but throughout the day otherwise, I'm not coughing."

"OK. Alright, and do you feel like your heart's racing?","No, no, nothing like that."
"No, you don't feel like you're breathing a lot more than usual?","Uh, no, I don't think so."

"OK, any allergies?","I do have, I think like, just seasonal allergies. I don't know if I'm allergic to pollen, but during the spring time I get allergies and then during the winter now I'm getting some of these symptoms that I'm talking about. So yeah, but none to any medications that I know of."
"OK, so you're not getting any night time symptoms, and you're only getting day time symptoms with activity, right?",Yeah.
Has this prevented you from going to work or school?,"Oh yeah, so I, just this past week, I usually do my running, like morning workout right before work, and just one of the days after I worked out, I felt just terrible, with this coughing and short of breath so I just decided to take a day off work that day. But then I realized it kind of goes away on its own, so for the other days I have been going to work."

"OK, OK, any old carpets, pets, mold or asbestos in the house?","No, nothing like that."
"OK, good. So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?","Yeah, I was just wondering if I should go back on the puffers. I don't have any right now, I just don't know if my asthma has just uh, come back."
"Yeah so, what we're gonna do is, we're going to do a PFT, so pulmonary function test on you, cause it's been a while since you've had one of those done. And that's just to check how well your lung is functioning, so we'll do that. We'll also maybe get a chest X-ray as well for baseline and depending on what those two come back as, we'll probably get you to use your short acting beta agonist puffer again and we'll also give you a long acting.",OK.
"As well as an inhaled cortico steroid. So, actually, you know what, we'll give you an inhaled cortico steroid and a short acting beta agonist because you can't use both the steroid and the long, so we'll start with those two. We'll start with the short acting as well as inhaled cortico steroid. And if we find that your asthma is just based on like, exertion or like something called athletic asthma, we can also try something called Cromolyn instead but we'll discuss that more. Right now our priority is to get your symptoms under control, so we'll start with the short acting as well as the inhaled cortico steroid. How does that sound?","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much."
"I understand that you've had a cough, can you tell me a little bit more about that?","Yeah, so I've had this cough now, it's been going on for about two weeks, just, just hasn't gone away."

Those were uh, yeah, that was last week for about three days, and then I started to feel better. But I still have this cough, that, it's still going on."
"So those other symptoms that you had last week that lasted about three days, are they all gone? are you still feeling fatigued or having a headache?","Those are both, yeah, they're gone."
"Hmm, It's only the cough?",Yeah I just have the cough.
"Is there any time, any specific time of the day that it's worse or better? Anything that triggers it?","Uhm, maybe like, maybe when I went out into the cold or, uhm, like, when I went for a run where I really kind of exerted myself, it brought it on, but other than those things, nothing."

It sounds like you had a, you had a cold last week and you just have this residual cough that's still there, and it's been two weeks and you're just worried about it, but otherwise you're feeling well, you don't have any other symptoms. Often times when we get sick, or we have an infection or inflammation of the, uhm, the airway, we can get a cough that lasts a long time and it might just take you a couple more weeks for the cough to go away. But if you feel that it's getting any worse or you're, you have those symptoms come back again, or you develop a fever, we can, you can definitely, we can do something more about that. I'll also do a physical exam and, and see how you're doing and then we can go from there.","OK, great, thank you."

You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days um, and if it's not COVID, if that comes back negative, and um yeah, some of your symptoms also sound like other typical viral symptoms, so you could have one of the common strains that's going around this time of year. So for that just, it's um, you should just um, do some supportive care, you know, staying hydrated, eating well. And if your symptoms become worse, uh, you're running a really high fever, you have any neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures, then you should seek help from the ER.

Um, so how much would you say you used to smoke?","Well, half a pack. Um, half a pack a day, but then over the past three years I've been trying to cut it down.

And um, are you just, are you using anything to help you quit smoking or are you doing it without any medications, or um, like, have you used anything in the past that has worked for you?","Um, no I, I went to my doc and he said to try on my own first and if I'm struggling with it to come back, but I've been doing it very gradually so it's, it's going well."
"Okay, and that's really good. And yeah, if you, at all, need any resources to help you quit smoking, it's great that you're doing really well, but if you need to talk more about it or need any more resources we can provide that for you.

No. How about alcohol?,"Uh, I just drink on the weekends. Maybe a glass or two of wine."
"Okay, and uh yeah. So those were kind of all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?",No.
No?,"I was, I guess I was just worried about the cough um, it's just, I was worried that it could be COVID."
"Yeah, so definitely right now, any of these symptoms, like COVID can have a lot of different symptoms um, so we should definitely make sure that we, to check if you have COVID or not and we'll get a COVID swab test done for you today, and the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh, and in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home. Try to wear a mask around your family members, um, trying to eat separately and use all those methods, and, and then after the test comes back you may, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be COVID either, it can be just another virus uh, like it can be just your common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gotten better. Oftentimes uh, a cough can be the last thing to go, it can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved, but it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms like no fevers or anything else right now, so it's, it's uh, that's, that's pretty good.","Great, I'm glad."
"Alright, yeah.",Thank you.

"And although she doesn't have any family history of it, it can happen without family history as well. Um so we would like to uh try and do uh what's called a pulmonary function test.

"And uh usually when she gets these types of symptoms, she can use the puffer to help her.

"Uhm, so covid does present in a variety of non specific ways and so it certainly could be on the differential for causing a sore throat and abdominal pain and as well as a fever. However, it could be caused by other things as well. Uhm, currently your constellation of symptoms, with the enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, sore throat, it sounds like you may have uhm, an inflamed spleen as well, which could all be signs and symptoms of something called EBV or, or mono. And it sounds like you might have had an exposure, like your husband or fiance rather may have had this last week with the sore throat. All that being said, today we'll do the monospot test to check for that as well as some blood work. And we will do a covid swab as well, just in case.","OK, that sounds good. Thank you."
So what brings you in?,"Yeah, so um I just came in because uh so I I have this cough that's been going on for the last five years, but over the last month it's really been getting worse. Um and like last week I I've just been constantly coughing. So yeah, I was just a bit concerned."

"OK, OK, um the cough that you currently have, um is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlegm?",Uh I'm pretty much always bringing up like this uh white material.
"White, OK. Um and is it constant throughout the day or do you find it comes and goes?","It's pretty much there all the time, but uh it's definitely getting worse. Um it is, I think, the worst in the morning um when I wake up and I just feel like there's just a bunch of gunk stuck in the back of my throat."
"OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled?",I would say it's harsh.
"Harsh, OK. And has the quality of your cough changed at all in the past few years? Like does it sound different than it used to?","Um I don't know if it sounds different, but uh especially for the last month I would say I'm bringing up more of the material, and it's usually white over the five years, but um I noticed uh in the last week-ish, it's had a yellowish tinge to it as well."
"OK, OK, so it's changed a little bit. Um and are you experiencing any shortness of breath with this?","No I I don't think so, like I sometimes when I'm walking around uh doing more stuff, uh working in the garden like I feel like I might have to breathe a little bit harder, but uh not regularly."

"Yeah, so it definitely sounds like a COPD exacerbation, but because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will take a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now. Um and hopefully your symptoms subside and we can get you home. How does that sound?","OK, that sounds good. Thank you so much."
"Yeah, no problem. And I forgot, sorry we'll also probably do like a chest X Ray and a pulmonary function test.","OK, sounds good."
How can I help you?,"Hi so I brought my 6 year old son in today because yesterday during soccer practice, he he developed this pretty severe cough and he couldn't catch his breath."
"OK, so this happened yesterday, you mentioned?","Yeah, it happened yesterday afternoon."

And does he sound wheezy to you?,"He does, yeah, he's still sounding a little bit wheezy now. It's it's better than last night. He was a bit more wheezy last night."
OK. Uhm how about shorter breath? Does he sound short of breath at all?,"No, that that's gotten a bit better, that resolved about an hour. Like after he stopped playing but he was, he was short of breath yesterday."
"OK, and have you tried anything for his cough, for his shortness of breath or wheezing?","No, we haven't"

"No, weight loss over the past few weeks?","No, he's been gaining weight well."
"OK good, has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?","Well, sometimes he will get a runny nose. He takes like Reactin or Claritin or some sort of allergy pill for that sometimes, but that's usually like the changing of seasons that will happen more often."
OK OK. Does he have any allergies?,"Yeah, to mostly environmental triggers. I'm not sure if the specific things are, but I just know it gets worse. Maybe in the spring, springtime?"

"OK, OK, any pets at home?",He's got a fish.
"A fish, OK. And has he has come into contact with anyone sick recently?","No, I don't think so. I mean when at school, they've been pretty diligent with I mean covid and everything right now, so I think he's been OK."
"Ok, uhm has he traveled anywhere recently?",No.
"No, OK. OK, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?","Yeah, I was just wondering if if my son had asthma as well and if like you need a prescription for inhalers."
"Yeah, so we're gonna since he's never been diagnosed before, we're gonna do some investigations for him just to start so we can do, we can start by doing a pulmonary function test for him to see what his lung activity is like uhm so we'll start there and then we'll also, because you're saying he's short of breath, we'll take his oxygen saturation as well, and maybe even do some like some basic blood work for him, and if it turns out he has asthma, which in this case I do strongly suspect, we'll prescribe him some bronchodilators like a short acting beta agonist as well as an inhaled corticosteroid because his symptoms do seem somewhat severe this time around. And then I should also mention because some of his symptoms overlap with that of COVID, he will also get a covid swab and you should hear back about that in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?","That sounds good, thank you."

Has anybody else in that house been sick?","No, no one has been sick recently, at least in my house, but uh, just two weeks ago I did attend a family event, and just last week I found out, uhm, someone was having symptoms.

"Yeah, certainly with nonspecific symptoms such as what you've been experiencing, we will do a test for covid today. However, we will do some lab investigations as well, because it could be something else, so we'll wait for some of those results to come back, and it's great that you've already taken the initiative to isolate from family members and whatnot. And so I ask you to continue doing so, and we will get back to you when the results are in.","OK, yeah, that sounds good, thank you so much."

OK. I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we end the interview?,"Uh, no, well  I guess I was just concerned about about COVID."
"Yeah, you know that's the top on my list of differential diagnosis for you. So what we'll do is a COVID swab and that should come back in a day or so, but we do encourage isolation for 14 days and that includes from your girlfriend as well. So even if the COVID swab comes back negative, sometimes it can be false negative, so as long as you're having these symptoms, and these symptoms are common in COVID,  we do ask that you isolate for 14 days if the swab comes back positive. We will also notify public health so that they can get in touch with you and do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten COVID from, but other than that, if it's not COVID, it could likely be another upper respiratory viral illness because of this time of year. A lot of different viruses are going around like common viruses or the flu, you know, so it could be one of those. And then if you're still sick or your symptoms change, we can reassess to make sure it's not a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, in which case we can prescribe antibiotics.","OK yeah, thank you for all that information. Sounds great."
"OK, well take care then, alright.",Thank you.
What brings you in?,"Yeah, so I just came in because I've been having this cough that's getting worse over the last uh one and a half week and uh, I've also just recently in the last few days been getting some shortness of breath. Um and I also noticed uh my bowel movements have changed a little bit as well over the last week."
"OK, so yeah, let's break this down. The cough, when did that start?","The cough, I think it started uh probably like around 10 days ago."
"10 days ago, OK, and how about the shortness of breath?",That just started in the last uh I think 3 days.
"OK, and then the the bowel bowel changes, when did that start?","Yes, I think it also started in like, I would say, for the last three days I've been getting uh diarrhea."
"OK OK, so let's go back to the cough, is it constant or um is it triggered by certain things like the cold air, dust, um you know, um, certain times of the day, like morning, evening?","Um, I would say it's pretty pretty constant since the last like 10 days, uh it's, there's no real pattern to it, and I've mostly just been inside my house. I don't think there are any triggers or I don't own any pets or anything like that, no new rugs, like uh, no no new changes really in my house."
"OK, OK and um have you tried anything to make it better?","Um, no, not really. I I've done some uh home remedies like trying to do one of those steam steam masks and see if that helps, but it didn't really do anything."
"OK. Um and how about um the quality of that cough? Is it, does it sound harsh?","Um, yeah I would say it's getting a little bit harsh. It's more just like, I'm not bringing anything up, it's more like a dry cough um, but yeah, I would say it's getting worse, definitely."
"OK. Um, is it a dry cough then, or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that?","No, no, I haven't seen any blood at all and rarely do I bring like up some sputum, but like most of the time it's just a dry cough."
"OK, it's a dry cough. Um and would you say the cough's getting worse?","Yeah, I'd definitely say in the last um three to four days I've been just coughing nonstop, it's very irritating."
"Yeah, have you experienced anything like this before?","Um, probably a few years ago, I think I caught the flu or something and got really sick with a fever and just a lot of coughing. But since then, nothing else."
"OK. Um the shortness of breath, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is it?","Uh probably like a five. It kind of just started out with uh, three days ago, was kind of like I just"
virus like mainly I'm worried about covid and you know just how fast that's spreading everywhere.,"Yeah, for sure. Um yeah, for sure, have you traveled to anywhere recently?"
"No, uh we've been in Canada, Ontario, haven't left to go anywhere.","OK. OK, well those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or did you have any concerns, anything that you wanted to discuss today?"
"Yeah no, I just uh was wondering if I can get the covid test, that would just, I wanted to make sure I don't give anyone covid if I do have it.","Yeah, for sure, I think that's a good idea. Um so, and it's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we'll do a covid swab today um and you'll hear back within 24 to 48 hours, um but in the mean time, regardless of whether you actually have covid or not, because your symptoms overlap with covid, um it's good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible, and public health should be in touch if it's positive uh to do contact tracing. Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER. How does that sound?"
"My, if my breathing gets worse uh I'll just go to the emergency Department?","Yes, please do."
"OK, sounds good.","Alright, take care."
What brings you in?,"Yeah, nice to meet you I, I've been having just over the last week my cough that's been getting worse and I had a fever a couple of nights and just yesterday I noticed that I started having a loss of taste and smell so that got me really worried."
"OK, so yeah, let's rewind a little bit. The cough you said started a couple of weeks ago, so would that be about 2 weeks? Three weeks?","I would say last week, so like 7 seven days ago."
"Seven days ago, OK. So that started seven days ago and then when did the fever start?","The fever I hasn't been constant, but I've like had some nights where I just feel really chilly and then during the day sometimes even getting these chills I've been recorded at a temperature, but I think I've had a fever at least three times in the last week."
"OK, so you haven't actually taken your temperature, but it you just feel like you have chills?",Yeah.
"OK, we could take your temperature today. And then the loss of smell and taste. Do they both happen at the same time?","I think the taste happened like before, but that was just yesterday and then yesterday morning like at breakfast, I couldn't really taste anything and then continued during lunch and dinner, but smell, I kind of lost around the evening."
OK.,"Yeah, all just started yesterday."
"OK. Um alright, so let's go back to the cough and has it been constant since it started?","Yeah, it's been pretty constant. It's been getting worse, especially like in the last few days. I'm mainly coughing like before I was coughing mainly at night, but now I'm coughing throughout the day."
"OK, um so yeah, you mentioned possibly a trigger would be like time of day at night? Or did you notice any other triggers like you know, the cold air or dust or anything at home that could be potentially triggering your cough?","Uh no, not really. Like I've lived in the same place for awhile, no new changes and I've been barely going outside, so I don't think there are any triggers."
"OK, and in terms of the quality of your cough is that, would you say it's harsh? Barky?","Uhm, I would just say it's like kind of harsh at times, but mainly it's a dry cough, like I'm not bringing anything up."
"OK, OK. And then you said dry cough so no sputum or blood right?",No.
OK. Have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?,"Not the loss of taste and smell, but like the other stuff when I just had a cold or flu like symptoms previously, but the taste and smell is something completely new."
"OK. And then, um, have you experienced any shortness of breath?","Um, not really, no."
"No, OK. How about we wheeziness?",No.
Chest pain?,No chest pain.
"OK. Uh, experienced any weight loss recently?","No, not that I know."
"OK, how about fatigue?","I have been a bit tired in the last few days. The fevers at night and morning. Just feeling a little bit crummy, just not really energetic, energetic to do anything."
"Yeah, for sure.","Just been planner, just sitting on the couch."

"OK, have you ever thought about cutting down?","Yeah, especially with this pandemic going on, it's been, I've been trying to cut down just because like I don't want to get the, get COVID and then you know my lungs are probably already weaker because of the smoking. So I've been trying to cut down."

Do you do marijuana?,"No, no, I've never tried marijuana."
"OK, how about other recreational drugs?","No, um, besides alcohol, nothing else."
"OK, and then um, I guess I'll ask you about the alcohol, uhm, how much do you drink?","Um, um, not that much. I'd probably say like a few times a week when there's a game on. I just grab a couple of beers, but that's about it."

Was there anything that you wanted to ask me or anything else that you wanted to discuss that I may have missed?","Uh, yeah, I I that I'm just wondering like I could it be COVID I I don't know. I don't know if someone in the office had it or yeah, it was just basically worried about, if I had COVID."
"Yeah for sure. that's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we will be doing a COVID swab on you and and you will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results. But regardless, because your symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID especially umm, the loss of smell and taste, we do recommend that you isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from family members as well. So we'll, that's where we'll start. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. But, we'll start with, we'll start with these COVID swabs. How does that sound?","Yeah, that sounds good. I'll, I'll let my work know and yeah, hopefully it comes back negative, but I'll stay away from everyone till then."

"OK, um, and so mostly fluid you said?",Yeah.
"OK, and what color is it?","Uhh, yeah, usually usually kind of like yellowish clear."
OK. Are you having any abdominal pain?,"Maybe like after I vomit it kind of feels like squeezing a little bit. But I think, yeah, I think yeah that's just really just with when I'm heaving."

"OK, alright, so um, any changes in in taste?","Um, maybe I mean, yeah, I think I might not be really tasting things the same."
"OK, how about smell?","Now that you say it, I might, uh, yeah I think my smell has been impacted as well. I can't really smell anything."

Yeah for sure. And how about any changes in your vision or hearing?,No changes to vision or hearing.
"OK, any discharge?","Uh, nothing like that that, but I mean my eyes were a bit, they've been a bit red these last two days."
"OK, have they been in any pain?","Nope, no pain and I've been able to see everything OK. It's just I just noticed they were a little bit more red. I just thought maybe I don't know I was, I've just been tired."

"Right, OK. It hasn't been intense you said? So have you had headaches like this in the past?","Yeah, I had similar headaches before I think. They come like this. Like if I didn't get a good sleep or from not drinking enough water or something, I'll kind of get a headache like this. Kind of feels like it's squeezing."
"Yeah, that's understandable. But it's not like the worst headache you've ever had?","No, no, it's pretty similar to headaches that I've had before."
"OK, OK, good, and are you otherwise healthy?","Yeah, well I have high blood pressure and also, high cholesterol, so I do take medications for both of those. So yeah, I take a statin and Amlodipine I think."
"D:OK, OK, good. It's good that you're on both of those. Do you take any other medications like over the counter medications or herbal supplements?","Yeah, I've been taking vitamin D and also a multivitamin. I heard that that we don't get enough vitamin D throughout the winter."
"Yeah, it's a great idea to take that, especially as we get older and if we live in a country where we don't get a lot of sun exposure like Canada, so that's good. And sorry before I move on, I forgot to ask you earlier if you have experienced any weight loss or night sweats recently?","No, my weight's been, uh, about the same unfortunately and I haven't had any night sweats. But I mean now that you asked if I felt more hot than than usual, maybe."
"OK, and did you take your temperature?","Uh, I did and the last time I checked it was a few days ago and at that time I didn't have a fever, but I mean, I'm still feeling hot so I'm not sure."
"Yeah, OK. Alright, so I'll go back to your past medical history. Have you been hospitalized or have you ever needed surgeries in the past?","Um, no. Like the last time I was in the hospital with, it was for a colonoscopy a few years ago which came back normal."

"OK, how about any stomach problems or liver problems? Colon problems?","Yeah, my dad actually had colon cancer. He was 70 and so that's why we went and decided to get a colonoscopy instead of just doing the immunohistochemistry test."
"OK, yeah, that's a good idea. Um, so it sounds like you're, you know, preemptive with your health, which is good. Any other cancers that run in the family?","No, just my dad had colon cancer."
OK. And do you smoke at all?,"No, I don't."
"D:OK, how about marijuana?","Um, no, I don't smoke marijuana."

"On the 8th floor, OK, any issues in terms of like old carpet or mold or asbestos in the apartment?","It's a newish building so there isn't really any carpet actually in the unit, so yeah, it's pretty clean that way."
OK good. That's good. So those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we ended the interview?,"Well, I'm just hoping to to get this sorted out and feel better."
"Yeah for sure. So you know, right now we're thinking it could be a viral GI viral infection because of your complaints of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever. But it could also be COVID and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms. Um, and then, so just going off of that, we'll wait for the swabs to come back. If they come back positive, we will notify public health and they'll do a trace to see where you could have gotten this infection from. And then meanwhile, we do suggest that you isolate for two weeks so that you don't spread the illness, and even if the swab comes back negative, there is still a chance that you may have COVID and it's a false negative test. So we'll start there. If it turns out you don't have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a, you know, bacterial picture, we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics. So that's where we will start. How does that sound?","Yeah, that sounds like a great start. Thank you."
What brought you in today?,"Yeah, so uh, just randomly like 2 days ago I just started having this chest pain when I'm breathing and it's just been getting worse and then because of that, I'm finding that I'm very short of breath as well, so I just got really concerned."
"OK, I see. When did the chest pain start?","So, there was some discomfort like just 2 days ago, but then just yesterday it started getting very painful when I was breathing. So yeah, I would say 1 day ago."
"OK, and were you doing anything at the time when the chest pain started? Like did you get in a car accident maybe? Or any trauma to the chest or anything you can think of?","No, not really.

It's kind of like in my right side of the chest and it feels like a stabbing pain."
"OK, and so the pain comes on when you breathe in, or yeah, when you take a deep breath. Does the pain come on at any other points or does it go away?","Uh, it's mostly, yeah, I feel the sharp pain when I breathe in."
"OK, so the pain is intermittent then, it sounds like. And has there been anything you've tried that's made the pain better?","Not really, just more shallow breathing, and it hurts less with that, but that's about it."
"OK, and are there any positions that help make the pain any better like leaning forward or laying down?","Not really, it's uh, it's pretty much the same, I think."
"OK, and uh, you mentioned you had shortness of breath as well. When does this come on?","Since yesterday it's been pretty constant and it's more like, Uh, just uh, I'm really having trouble getting any deep breaths in, so I feel like I'm having to just breathe faster and more shallow."

"OK, and have you been experiencing any headaches?",No.
"How about any viral symptoms, like eye redness, nasal discharge, or nasal congestion or cough?","I have been having a little bit of a cough, but that's it, like, it kind of started today, but it's nothing too significant."

"OK, and uh, any cancers that run in the family?",Not that I know of.
"OK, so it sounds like you had this uncomfortable feeling in your chest about two days ago, but the pain really came on yesterday and it's really painful when you have a deep deep breath. So, in conjunction with your symptoms of not being able to take a deep breath and being short of breath, it sounds like you possibly have what's called a pneumothorax and so we'll do a physical exam and do a chest X-ray as well to examine this and check vitals as well to make sure that you're work of breathing is OK and we can do some blood work and go from there.","OK, yeah, sounds good. Should be like, worried at all?"
"I think right now, you're speaking in full sentences and you're not short of breath at rest, typically, when this this happens, if it's small enough, it'll usually resolve on its own and so we'll get some more information from the imaging and the lab results, but it's reassuring that you haven't been getting worse since it happened.","OK, alright, sounds good. Thank you so much."

"OK, any trouble recently?",No no.
"No, OK. Well, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?","Uhh no, just was wondering what what might be going on?"
"Yeah, for sure, so right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. Uhm An antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. Uhh how does that sound?",That sounds really good. Thank you.
How may I help you?,"Hi, so yeah I I'm really worried. I started coughing up blood this morning, and for the last two days I've been having some, like on my right calf, just a lot of swelling and tenderness. Uhm, I just actually got out of the hospital just last week. I had a knee replacement surgery on my right leg. So yeah, I was just really concerned about this blood that I'm coughing up."
"Yeah, certainly. So when, so you had a knee surgery last week, were you like immobilized afterwards for periods of time?","P:Yeah, I've been just taking some rest, not really doing too much. And even in the hospital, like I was there for a day and was pretty immobilized."
"OK, and have you had any pain in your calf, and if so, which which one?",It's just the right calf and it's it's pretty swollen right now and I was having a lot of pain over it for the last two days.
"OK is it, can you feel the pain at rest, or or is it with uh like with movement? Or if you press on it?","It's yeah, it's pretty tender when I press on it. I haven't really been moving around, and it's still like painful right now, but it doesn't really hurt when I'm like, like I've been trying to keep myself rested just because of the surgery, but when I press on it, it is pretty tender."
"OK, and is the is the swelling in kind of one spot of your leg, or is it most of the of the leg?","It's just the calf, I would say more like just the lower leg area."
"OK. Have you noticed any skin changes, like redness or or or temperature like it feels hot to touch.",Maybe a little bit. I haven't really noticed it too much.
"OK, and do you have a history of like varicose veins or anything like that?","No, nothing like that."
OK. So uhm when did the coughing up blood start?,"Just this morning actually. So just uh, like I would say a couple hours ago."
"OK, and how much blood are you coughing up?","Just some on like I just notice on the tissue like just some spots that I noticed every time that I'm, like, I would have to cough it up. Maybe like in the last couple hours, I've had three episodes of that where I've noticed blood on the tissue."
I see and did you ever cough prior to this?,"No, not really."
"OK, uhm, and have you been experiencing any infectious symptoms like red or runny eyes, runny nose, sore throat?","No, nothing like that."
Have you been having any chest pain or or shortness of breath?,"No chest pain, but I do feel like I do have to take like a deeper breath. Like I've just been feeling it this morning a little bit. It's just kind of a bit of uneasy breathing."
"OK, so it has been more difficult to breathe. And is that is that at rest as well, do you feel that kind of sensation?","Yeah, even right now, just a little bit, like it's it's not anything that I'm too worried about, but it is there."

"Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns?","Uh no, that sounds great, thank you."
"You're welcome and yeah, we'll, just do a full examination and then go from there.","OK, sounds great thanks."

Did you have any questions of your own for me?","Yeah, uh, with all this COVID and the pandemic going on, I don't know, I like, I've been mainly at my house, but like I said I do go to do my own groceries. Of course I wear a mask, but I don't know if I might have caught COVID,  so that's something I was worried about."
"Yeah, for sure. I think just because your symptoms do overlap with those of COVID, we will be doing a COVID swab today and you should hear back about your results in 24 to 48 hours. But you should still self-isolate for 14 days because you do have similar symptoms and if it's not COVID, it's probably another viral illness that's going around these days and for that you don't need any medication, like prescribed medications, but just keep an eye on that, on your symptoms. Stay hydrated, eat well. If you need to lower your feve, you can use Tylenol. And if your symptoms worsen or you start getting neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?","Sounds good. I just had another quick question. I did get the shingles and the pneumococcal vaccine back then but I didn't get the flu vaccine, like should I get it? Is it recommended?"
"Yes, it's definitely recommended. So we won't give you the vaccine right now because you have symptoms. But once you are healthy again, you should definitely get the get the flu vaccine and you should get it once a year.","OK, I just never took those vaccines, but I'll do that from now on."
"Yeah, it's a good idea, and even if you get the flu, your symptoms won't be as severe if you have the vaccine, so it's definitely something to consider.","OK, alright sounds good."

"Yeah, you know, um, right now it looks like, it sounds like it could be an upper respiratory viral illness, so that includes COVID.  So we will do a swab for you and then send it off to the lab for PCR results. In the meantime, because you have symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, we do encourage isolation for 14 days. Until your symptoms are gone, sorry,  until your symptoms are gone, even if they're gone, we do suggest isolating for 14 days just to make sure you're not a carrier or could spread COVID so we do encourage that, and that includes from your husband. If possible, we will get those results in a day or two. If they are positive, we will send your results to public health who will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten it from. If it's not COVID, it could be other viral illnesses that are going around this time of year. And if your symptoms aren't getting better on their own, and there's reason to suspect you may have a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, we will follow up with you and possibly prescribe antibiotics.

"No, OK. Alright, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview?","Uh no, not really. Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now."
"Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work.",OK.
"Yeah, how does that sound?",That sounds good. Thank you so much.

Um if he hasn't been eating, drinking well, hasn't slept well, has been fussy, and and has been lethargic and tired, uh and is having difficulty swallowing food, um that's definitely very um serious. Uh we'll have a look inside his mouth and see what's going on. It could be that he has an infection or an inflammation of some sort. Um given his fever, he probably has an infection, um and uh we'll likely start him on antibiotics and put in an IV drip just to get in get some fluids inside him, just to get him hydrated, uh and monitor him very closely.

And if it's positive, public health will be in touch umm, to do some contact tracing. In the meantime, because you have a cough, it is recommended that you isolate for 14 days. And if it's not Covid, but it's probably something like acute bronchitis or some other viral infection that's going around at this time of year, so for that we can, you can just treat it with like supportive treatments. You know, like staying hydrated, uhm, good nutrition, good sleep and just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse or really severe like you're having neurological symptoms and just seek help from the ER.",For sure. Thank you.

"Yeah, so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms, especially with uhm, starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough, headache, muscle aches, so certainly could be caused by covid, but there are other reasons for, that could explain these symptoms, such as other types of viral illnesses, and so we will do a PCR swab today, as well as do, well, check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we'll also maybe send an influenza swab as well, and and do some blood work. But in the meantime, since we're running the covid swab, it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show.

"Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there.","Alright, sounds good, thank you so much."
So what brings you here today?,"Yeah I have my 2 year old daughter here with me. I don't know what's happening with her, but she seems to be getting really sick. So I'll give you that kind of timeline. So two days ago she was feeling hot and her fever hasn't broken. We've been giving her Tylenol, but she still seems to have a fever. The last time I checked her temperature was 38.5 and she seems to have issues swallowing food. She's drooling and she seems short of breath."
"OK, and when did she start getting short of breath?",That started yesterday.
Has her fever been getting worse or has it stayed around the same?,"So I just checked the first day. It was like 38, 38.5."
"OK, and when did the trouble swallowing start?",That started yesterday as well.
"OK, and has it been getting worse at all?",I think so. Now she's barely even drinking fluids.
"OK, so it's both solids and fluids. OK, have you noticed any swelling in her neck area or redness or swelling in her throat?","Yeah, I've noticed some of that."
"OK, you see a lot of redness in there?","I see, yeah, I see quite a bit of redness in there."
And has she been drooling at all?,"Yeah, a little bit today."
"OK. Alright, any coughing?",Not hat I noticed.
"No coughing. OK, and do you notice that she's increasingly fatigued, or just not herself? Or is she irritable?","Yeah, she's very irritable."
"OK, do you notice any kind of paleness or blueness in her skin? Anything like that?",She's not blue. She's looking a little pale though.
"OK, and sorry, when did the shortness of breath start? Is it getting worse at all?","Shortness of breath started yesterday as well, moreso today which is why I brought her in."
"OK, any other symptoms like nausea or vomiting or diarrhea or constipation?","Um, no nothing like that."
"OK, and how's her appetite and sleep?","It's been, it's been not great. She's not eating well, I guess because she's in a lo of pain and she didn't sleep well for the past two nights either."

"OK, and did it just go away on it's own or did she need any antibiotics or any other medications?","I think no, she didn't need any antibiotics. It kind of went away on its own."
"OK, any sick contacts within the last week or two weeks?","I mean, she goes to daycare so she might have picked something up from there. Yeah, last I checked, no one at daycare was sick like right now. But three weeks ago there was someone who was sick."
"OK, any past medical history?","Um, no, she's been pretty healthy otherwis."
Any issues during pregnancy or after birth at all?,No.
Are her immunizations are up to date?,"Um, yes, she didn't get the H. flu vaccine though."
"OK, OK, any hospitalizations or anything like that in the past?","Um, no."
"OK, and any family history of any medical conditions?","Um, no."
"And currently, who does she live with at home?",I'm she lives with myself as well as her older brother.
"OK, alright, so yeah those are all the questions that I have.",Do you think this is like an urgent matter?
"Because she has not been vaccinated with the H.flu vaccine and some of the symptoms that she's displaying like the drooling and trouble swallowing and now especially the shortness of breath are very concerning, I really think we should go to the Emergency Department. I'll give them a call to le them know that you're coming. Yeah, and what they will most likely do there is get a test done to see if she has H. flu and also they might do perhaps like a COVID swab as well. They might get an X Ray of her neck as well to see it. So what I think might be going on is with H. flu you can get swelling of your epiglottis and it can kind of obstruct your throat. It's very urgent matter, so that's why we will make sure you get to the ER and, uh, you know, we'll go from there. Does that sound? I know it may be very worrying right now. Do you have any questions at all?","Yeah, do you know how long will she have to be in the hospital?"
"So right now we just need to make sure that she's stable, like all her vitals. You know when she gets to the ER, they can give her the appropriate antibiotics as well. And based on that, we need to make sure her breathing get stabilized, so she might be in the ER for one day. If they think she needs to be on IV antibiotics in the hospital, she might be in the hospital for a few more days or even a week. So it's really hard to say right now, but our priority right now is to make sure she's stabilized in the ER.","OK. OK yeah, that sounds good."
"So I'll give them a call right now, and, uh, you can head over to the ER. Or if you need a ride, we can arrange to do that for you too.","OK, great, that sounds great."
Thank you.,You too.
How may I help you?,"So, I just came in here because for the last day I've been just getting shortness of breath. I recently, yesterday actually, was just busy at home, cleaning out my basement. And, like that was yesterday afternoon, I did that for a couple hours and then at night I just started to get the shortness of breath. It's continued until today. I'm also getting some wheezing and tightness in my chest as well as some cough. So yeah, that's all just been happening over the last day."
"OK, and uh, is the shortness of breath here now? is it, is at rest? Or are you having that when you're exerting yourself?","More so when I'm like exerting myself, if I'm sitting down it's better, but I still have, I would say, like my breathing is not normal right now, like it's, I still have to take deeper breaths. And I do have that chest tightness when I take those deep breaths."
"OK, do you have any chest pain?","No, it's more so just the tightness. I wouldn't call it pain, but I do still have a little bit of wheezing."
OK.,"So yeah, that's, that's that."
"And you mentioned a cough as well. With the cough is it, has it been dry, or have you been bringing up sputum?","Uhm, it was, it was mainly dry yesterday, like, like the cough has kind of gone away, but yesterday night I was coughing a lot and it was mostly dry."
"OK, have you brought up any blood?",No.
"OK, and have you had any infectious symptoms like, eye tearing or red eyes, maybe a runny nose or sore throat?","Uhm, not a sore throat, but it does feel like it, it's kind of like just constricted in there like, uhm, I don't know if it's relevant, but I, I do have asthma. Uh, like I was diagnosed ten years ago, but it's been pretty stable, like it's, like just right now. I haven't had shortness of breath for a pretty long time."
"OK, uh, and, uh, we'll get back to the past medical history shortly, I just wanted to ask a few more symptoms, but certainly could be relevant today.

"OK, and do you use inhalers for that?","Yeah, I have two inhalers, uh, like one, one is like a blue one, one is like an, like an orange one, uh, it's, so I think it's one of them is just like, I take whenever I really need to and the other one I take every day. Uhm, and I haven't been taking the one, uh, I think it's called Ventolin. But I took it like, uh, had to take it like three or four times last night and like, throughout the day yesterday. And it, it did help, but it didn't really relieve some of my symptoms."
"OK, and prior to that, how often have you been using, uhm, the blue one.","The blue one before yesterday, probably the last time I used it was probably like a month ago."
"OK, so you don't need it that that often then?",No.
"Do you have any triggers for asthma that you're aware of, like exercising or going out into the cold or even like allergies like dust or, or, or pollen?","Uhm, I do have allergies in the spring. I think it's to pollen and in the winter, it does, like my symptoms do get a bit worse and I have to use the ventil more. But recently for the last few months at least, it's been pretty stable. I haven't really had to use, use it too much."
"OK, and, and do you use any other medications?","Uh, just when I have allergies. I, I just use over the counter allergy meds."

"OK, and  sorry, just had to backtrack a little bit. Have you had any hospitalizations, either due to asthma or for any other reason?","Uhm, I think when I was 15, I, I had to go to the emergency department, but I, I wasn't hospitalized."
"OK, and was this, uh, did you have similar symptoms at that time?","Yeah, it was, uh, it was for asthma and like, uh, that time it was definitely much much worse and I remember like I was breathing a lot, uh, the shortness of breath was really bad and the ventolin like puffers weren't even helping me at that time."
"OK yeah, OK, and have you had any surgeries before?",No.
"Alright, so yeah, you mentioned that you're, you're cleaning up the basement yesterday? Was there a lot of dust down there or anything like that, that might have triggered it?","Yeah, we were like just moving boxes. There were books here and there that definitely there would have been dust. I should have been more careful, like wore a mask, but I didn't think about it at that time."

So the next part we'll go on to do a physical exam, but did you have any thing else that maybe I forgot to ask about today?","Uh, no, I, I, I think I know what this was caused by, but yeah, let's, let's see. Thanks for your help."
"Oh you're welcome, so yeah, we'll, we'll, uhm,trial some more puffers and see what we could do, cause certainly it's sounding like an asthma exacerbation, and so definitely let somebody know if your, your breathing is getting more difficult.","Yep, sounds good."

"OK um alright well uh, and you said that you don't have a family history of any problem?",No.
"Yeah OK, alright, I think that's all the questions I had for you. So uh looks like you've had a fever, cough, and a um and a headache that's gotten worse in the past four days and your headache's pretty bad, a seven out of ten. Um and uh it could be that you have uh some sort of an infection, uh including um, with Covid being one of the possibilities, and so um continue to take Tylenol and and um monitor your uh fever. If it continues to get worse, or you um notice that your symptoms are just not getting better, um you should come back, you should uh, we'll also do a Covid, we'll also send in a request for a Covid swab. Um and uh we'll ask you to quarantine for the for the next 14 days and try to stay away from your husband and daughter as well, if you can at home. Um and uh I guess a couple of other questions that I wanted to ask and I should have asked earlier, do you have any um any stiffness in your neck or any difficulties moving your neck?","Uh no, nothing like that."

"OK, does it feel dull and achy, or does it feel more sharp?",It feels pretty sharp.
"OK, and is it constant like on all the time, or do you feel like it kind of comes and goes?",It comes and goes. I would say I it might last for um 20-30 minutes at a time and then it goes away.
"OK, and over the last two weeks since you said it started, has it gotten any worse?","Uh, no. It's been about the same."
"About the same, OK, and has it gotten more frequent, these like 20 to 30 minute episodes?","No, it's happened about two or three times during the 2 weeks."
"And if you were to rate it on a scale of zero to 10, zero being no pain and 10 being like the worst pain you've ever felt, where would it fall?",I would say a 4 out of 10.
"OK. Uh, can you think of anything that that you've done differently recently that could have brought it on or is there any kind of common factor between the times that you had the pain?","Um,  I don't know I've separated from my husband 2 two years ago which has been really stressful but other than that I mean I can't really think of any changes to my health or anything like that recently."
"OK, but do you feel like you have been more stressed out in general?","Uh, yeah the last couple of years have been a lot more stressful because of those issues in my personal life."
"OK, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that you're coming in and we can hopefully get to the bottom of this. Not that I think that's necessarily the source of your pain, and we definitely want to look into everything, but it is really helpful to know that. So when you've had these episodes, have you taken anything to help with the pain or done anything that's that you felt it made it go away?","Uhm, I've tried some Advil, some Tylenol and actually some Tums as well, and it hasn't really helped."
"OK, do you think it's worse when you're moving around, if you're if you're kind of doing more exercise, or is it kind of just the same no matter what you're doing when you get the episodes?","Oh, it actually I I feel like it happens most of the time when I'm either at work or or driving."
"OK. OK, and before this two week period, have you ever had anything like this before?","No, I haven't had anything like this happen before."

"OK, do you have any allergies?",No allergies.
And is there any history of heart problems in your family?,"Yeah, my father had a heart attack when he was 60 just last year and it's actually one of the reasons what concerns me about the chest pain that I thought I was having."
"For sure, it always feels very concerning when when you have these these symptoms and that and you know people in your life that have had issues like similar issues in the past. I don't know that this is related to that. I I personally don't think so at this point, but we're definitely going to do everything to look into it and and rule out something that would be scary like that. I'm going to ask you few more questions about your lifestyle in general. Do you smoke cigarettes?","Yeah, I smoke about half a pack to a pack per day. I've been trying to quit and I was smoking more one pack per day, but so it is down a little bit, but, It's still something I'm trying to work on."
"Congratulations, that's a really tough thing to do so, good for you. That's that's really exciting. Step in the right direction, right? Do you drink alcohol?","Um, I do, but, uh, I'll have maybe one or two glasses of wine on the weekend."
Do you use any other substances?,Uh no.
"I know that you said you don't see your family doctor for anything regularly, but I just want to check a couple of specific things like have you ever been told you have high blood pressure?","No, I've never been told I've I've had high blood pressure."
And have you ever been told you have like high cholesterol?,"I haven't, but I've actually never been tested either."
"OK, and do you exercise regularly?","Yeah, actually, I'll either do some running or cycling, probably three or four days per week and I haven't had any chest pain or or problems exercising."
"OK, that's good to hear. And have you ever had problems with heartburn?","Uh. I don't think so, no."
"OK. OK, so just to kind of summarize what we've talked about, over the last two weeks, you started having these 20 to 30 minute episodes of chest pain that's on the left side, it feels more sharp, is that correct?",Yeah.
"And it's kind of constant when it comes on, there's nothing really that makes it better or worse, it just kind of goes away on its own after half an hour or so, it has kind of stayed the same over over the last two weeks, hasn't really gotten worse or better, it hasn't gone away either?","Right, yeah exactly."
"You never had anything like that before and you have been, it sounds like experiencing some stress in your life, it definitely can play into that as well. OK, is there anything else that you wanted to to tell me about that I didn't ask you today?","Uh, no, I think that's um, yeah, I think that's all that I wanted to talk about today."
"OK, so what I'm going to do is bring all this information to your family doctor and we can come back together and talk to you about the next steps.","Awesome, thank you."

"Uh all right, well um that's all the questions I had. We'll do a physical exam, have a look inside your throat. Um given uh the symptoms that you have, it sounds like you have um an an inflammation or swelling of your throat which could be caused by bacteria or viruses. It could be something like um mono, or it could be um strep throat. Um it could be other things as well. Um seeing that your symptoms are somewhat overlapping with the symptoms for covid, we would also like to do a Covid test. Um we'll do a rapid strep test here as well um just to rule it out and then uh we'll uh ask you to quarantine for the next 14 days um until or at least until your covid swabs are back or your symptoms improve um and we'll let you know about um the management based on the strep test result.

OK good good. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Anything that you wanted to bring up that I didn't touch on today?,"Yeah, I was just really worried that this could be COVID. I mean I have a cough and just have been feeling really hot so I was just concerned about that."
"Yeah, for sure, and I think that's a valid concern. So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?","Alright, yeah, that sounds good, so I guess I will kind of self isolate until the COVID results come back."
"Oh yes please do so. That's that's a great point. I do suggest isolating for two weeks at least if you have any sort of symptoms, because even though the PCR that we do to test for COVID is supposed to be reliable and it's supposed to be specific and sensitive, there are sometimes false negative tests. You know, just to be on the safe side, if you're experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, isolate for two weeks. But by the end of the week we should know what the test results are and then you will know for sure what you have.","OK, awesome, thank you."
What brings you in here?,"I've had this cough for over a week now, and it just hasn't gone away."
"OK, and uh, so this cough has been going on for a week. Can you describe the cough a little bit for me?","Yeah, so I mean sometimes I produce sputum and sometimes I don't. It's uh, white and whiteish clear in color."
"OK, um, and it's been going on for more than a week.Has it been getting worse?","It got a little bit worse at first, but then it's been kind of the same, um, since."
"OK, have you noticed at all, um, like green or yellow color of your sputum or any blood tinged sputum?","Uh, No blood, and maybe a little yellowish."
"OK, little yellowish, OK. And how much would you say you bring up, um, on an average day?","Uh, a couple of teaspoons."
"Couple of teaspoons OK.OK, has there been anything that um, makes it worse or better?",Nothing that I can think of.
"OK, and have you had this happen to you previously in the past?",No.
"And is the cough uh, constant or does it come and go?","It comes and goes, uh, throughout the day. No particular time of the day it's worse."
"OK, and, um, are you having any, uh, other symptoms besides the cough, um, like shortness of breath,sore throat, um, runny nose, congestion, anything like that?","Uh. yeah, I've had, um, a sore throat, uh, and a headache, as well."
"OK, and when did the sore throat start?","Um, that started about five days ago."
Five days ago? And has it been getting worse?,"No, that's been about the same."

"OK, were you on any kind of medications or antibiotics at all?","No, just went away on its own pretty quickly."

"You said it's more than a week now, right?",Yes.
"Yeah, so what we will do today is, uh, first of all, with the pandemic going on, with some of these symptoms, we need to rule out coronavirus. And so we will be getting a swab done for you as well today and considering you are having these symptoms, we will also get another test done for you today to see if there's any bacteria causing what we call walking pneumonia. It's community acquired pneumonia that's fairly common in like the younger population. And so we'll see if you could have that. And so from there we'll see if we need to put you on any antibiotics which will help you. And if we need to get any blood work or X Rays we'll let you know as well. Is that OK? And if you feel like you have worsening symptoms like shortness of breath, you need to make sure you come back to the Emergency Department.","Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."

Do you think it's COVID?"
"Yeah, so definitely at this time, you know whenever people have any respiratory symptoms we always want to rule out COVID.  So will definitely get a swab for COVID testing done for you today which should come back within 24 to 48 hours and in the meantime you should self isolate. And other than that, it can also be, due to this swelling in your lymph nodes and also just the other symptoms, it can be other viral infections. It can be mono so we definitely have to do a couple of tests, and there's one test that will do for mono as well which is called EBV antibody testing. So we'll do a couple of these tests today and then see what what comes back. And in the meantime you should definitely self isolate if you haven't been doing so already.","OK, sure I can do that."
"Yeah, do you have any questions?","No, that sounds good. Thank you so much."

"OK. And, any fatigue or exhaustion?","Energy's pretty much the same, just really complaining a lot about the throat."
"OK, OK, have you noticed any swelling in in the neck area?","Uhm, I think there might be like a few lumps near his neck, so I don't know if that's swelling, but definitely there is. There's a few that I felt over the last few days."

"OK, um, and how about shortness of breath or wheezing?","No, nothing like that."

"OK, how about in nausea or vomiting?","No, no, he hasn't told me anything about that."
Any appetite changes?,"Yeah, just with the trouble swallowing I'm trying to make sure that he gets like liquids because over the last few days he can't tolerate like solid foods at all."
"Yeah, how about a weight loss over the past few weeks?","No, not really. t's just been over the last few days that he hasn't been eating like himself."
OK. Alright and has he been healthy otherwise?,"Yeah, otherwise he's a very healthy child. We have rarely gone to a doctor for him before, so yeah, nothing. Nothing else with him."

"OK, any reason to believe you have old carpets, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering his symptoms?","You know we don't have any pets. We don't have any like old carpets, it's a fairly new apartment, so I don't think any of that should be an issue."
"Okay, well, I think those are all the questions that I had for him. Anything that you wanted to add or anything that I missed today?","Uh, no, I think those are everything I wanted to talk about but I just was wondering if he needs to get tested or like if there's anything we can do today for him."
"Yeah, so he does seem to be checking off some of the criteria for strep throat. So just to make sure, because he does have a score of right now at least three or four, or maybe even five, definitely over four, we can prescribe him some antibiotics. But we will do a rapid strep test first in the clinic here today just to rule out in or rule that out. If it comes back positive and I guess even if it isn't positive because he checked off a lot of the boxes for strep throat, we will give him a prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days. And then you can take that if his symptoms don't go away in a day or two. Because his symptoms also overlap with COVID, we will. do a swab for that as well and you should hear back within 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days. Does that sound good?","Yeah, that sounds good."
"OK, great thank you.",Thank you.
How may I help you?,"I'm here because um I've been having some pain in my left knee for the past two months and it's not getting better.

I wouldn't recommend ibuprofen or NSAIDs on a long term basis, although you could take those if you're having like an acute flare up of your pain. Um and then also like topical agents such as um like Voltaren or something like that you could put on your knee and um if it's really bad and it keeps um continuing on, we can consider something like a steroid injection as well.","OK, yeah, that sounds good.

"Yeah, you know, that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for, so I would say COVID or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year. That would have less of a similar presentation, and so we will do a COVID swab for you. And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, and that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics. So that's where we will start, does that sound good?","Yeah, that makes sense."

"Okay, so yeah, there's definitely like the coughing and shortness of breath are definitely concerning, and they've been going on for a pretty long time. Do you ever have any night sweats or anything like that?",No.
"Okay. So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of breath and a cough. One could be just a COPD diagnosis with your long history of smoking. And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?",Yeah.
What brings you in?,"Hi, I was just really worried. My son just yesterday night I noticed that he was making these grunting noises and I did notice that he was a bit warm yesterday as well, and today I, he just hasn't been himself, just very, very irritable, crying a lot. Yeah, I just got bit worried."
"Yeah, for sure. What started first?","I would say the there was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise, and he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that."
OK. Uhm did you measure his temperature at home?,"Yeah, so I think it was 38.5 degrees Celsius."
"OK, and did you do that orally or rectal or under armpit?",I did it under the armpit.

OK is he coughing at all?,He was yesterday but not really now.
OK and was it a dry cough?,"I think so. I mean, not-nothing really came out."
"OK, that's good. So no blood, no sputum?",No.
"OK, and did he seem wheezy?","Uh, no."
"No, OK. So there's no wheezing with the grunting?","Maybe a little bit like that, just a little bit of a noise, but it's mostly the grunting."
OK. Has he had any weight loss?,"No, not that I really, we haven't really weighed him now since his last appointment."
OK. Does he seem excessively tired or fatigued?,"Uhm, moreso today I would say he's like earlier, he was very fussy, but now he seems a bit more tired."
OK. Any rashes that you've noticed?,No.
"No, OK. Uhm any changes in his vision or hearing?","Uh, no, not that I can tell."
"No, OK. So he's responding to like sounds and he's still looking at you and things like that?",Yeah.
OK. Have you noticed a runny nose or stuffy nose?,"Uhm, no, nothing like that."
"No, OK. And he said he hasn't had any like fainting spells?","Uh, no, I don't think so."
"No, OK. And how many wet diapers is he producing in a day now?",Probably 5 or 6.
5 or 6 OK. Has that changed from before?,"No, it's pretty much the same."
"OK, and uhm any changes to his bowel movements?",No.
No. How about his urine?,No.
"No, OK. OK. And then you said he was fussy, is he still eating and drinking OK?","Uh no, today he's not really taking anything in, like very fussy, very hard to feed him today."
"OK, is he crying a lot?","Earlier today was crying a lot, but now has calm down and just I guess tired himself out."
"Yeah, OK. Alright, and is he an otherwise healthy child?","Yeah he was, he was premature by three weeks so, Other than that like I remember when he was born they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough and they had to like keeping, keep us in the hospital for a bit longer."
OK.,"But yeah, after that, like there haven't really been too many concerns."
"OK, so he's hitting all the developmental milestones like in terms of motor movements, ah speech, behaviour, all of that?","Yeah, no issues there so far."
"OK, and how about medications? Is he on any?",No.
"No medications, OK. And is up to date with all his immunizations?","Yeah, oh he had all his immunizations so far."

OK. Any travel recently?,No.
"No, OK. And who does he live with at home?","Uh, so his older sister, me and his mother."
"OK, any reasons to believe like you have old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything like that that could worsen his symptoms?","Uh, no nothing like that."
"OK, so I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns? Anything that I missed that you wanted to add?","No, I think that was all."
"OK, uhm so for him we'll do a Covid swab just to rule that out because some of his symptoms do overlap with that. But it it's really sounding like a picture of like community acquired pneumonia, so we'll do a couple of things for him. Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia. Yeah, does that sound OK?",That sounds good. Thank you.
What brings you in here today?,"Hey, I just, um, I just kind of came in to talk about my stuffy nose. It's yeah, it's been a problem for, I don't even know how many years it's always been there. And now that school is a little less busy and things are virtual and have more time, I decided I'll get something done, um, to get it fixed."

"OK, and then do you like how often are you getting the stuffiness? Is it like every day? Is it during the day at night? When do you usually get it?","It's kind of uhm, it's kind of all the time, to the point that I've somewhat gotten used to it. And it's just my, it's only on the left side and it's just always kind of stuffy. Initially I would have trouble falling asleep 'cause it would, I would just find it a little bit bothersome, but now I'm kind of just used to it."
"OK, and so it's just on the left side. It never moves to the right side.","Well, like sometimes when I get ill its on both sides, but usually it's on the left side."
"OK, and so you have stuffiness. But do you ever get any kind of discharge or drainage from your nose?",Sometimes I get a little bit bleeding.

"OK, uhm. Have you tried anything for it like either medications or the neti pot or steaming and has anything helped you at all?","I tried steaming but it didn't do much. It kind of got better. Maybe for an hour maybe, but then yeah, it didn't do much."

"Ok. So yeah, so mainly yeah. So there's all the questions I had for you. Do you have any questions or concern?",Nope.
"Ok so there can be many different reasons for this chronic congestion and we'll do a full physical examination for you today. Uh and some of the possible things that can be happening is you might be having a sinus issue like a chronic sinusitis. You can be having an allergic rhinitis or with the snoring and just the chronic congestion. You may be also having something called obstruct, obstructive sleep apnea. And there can be structures in your mouth, throats that can cause you to kind of obstruct and snore at night as well, and that even the congestion might cause that as well. So yeah, we'll do a couple test first and then if required, we might need to do some imaging and even perhaps send you to an EMT specialist if we think it's obstructive sleep apnea there. For now, we'll just do the physical examination to go from there.","Great, thank you."
What brings you in?,"I brought my son in today because he had a fever that started two days ago and, and then since then he he's had a cough that started as well and it it he's been short of breath. It looks like he's like breathing faster and just having a harder time to breathe."

"OK, umm, and it does anything help with that? So does sitting up help? Or, uh, you know, getting fresh air or anything like that?","No. But you'd say, like taking a smaller breaths helps because like if he if he takes a deep breath and he gets, he gets like chest pain."
"OK, OK, and how about when he's laying down?","No, he hasn't said anything like, like that for laying down just I think when he's just taking a deep breath, he said."

"OK. Any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, anything that could exacerbate his condition?","No, I don't think so. It's a newer home."
"OK, good. Umm, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?","Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though."
"OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?",That sounds great. Thank you.

"OK um, so no reasons that you were visiting farms and like being around birds or anything like that?","Um, not really, but I I do think like the old building that we lived in might have had asbestos. Does that does that like count at all?"
"Like a it could be important, uh, because, uh, well how long, how long did you live there for?",I would say almost 20 years.
"OK, so um, yes, that definitely would be is is important for the history today because, unfortunately, long term exposure to asbestos when breathing it in can cause some of the symptoms that you've been describing along with cough and uh, respiratory symptoms. So it'll be something that we'll be sure to investigate today, OK? But I just had a couple more questions. First, do you smoke cigarettes?","I quit long time ago, more than like 10 years ago, but I used to smoke like 5 to 10 cigarettes for around 20 years."

"OK, so next we'll do your physical exam and order some investigations. But currently thinking that it could be related to asbestos exposure as well as um, something called, well, it could cause pulmonary fibrosis and then also the joint pains that you've been experiencing might be another symptom that is suggestive of a connective tissue disease, and it doesn't sound like you have a family history of those, but we will do some lab work and investigations for for those including a chest X-Ray and a chest CT.",Sounds good.

So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, a sore throat. So the first thing that we want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat and then well if that comes back negative we will go from there and think about other viral causes versus strep throat as well.",Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?

"OK and no pain on hip adduction. OK, well those are all the questions that I have for you. Do you have any questions for myself?",Uh just wondering about possibly like what it could be.
"Yeah, um so it sounds um right now like you may have some sort of uh sacral nerve radiculopathy um or or like a lower lumbar, lumbar um radiculopathy, um basically uh that's known as sciatica, uh where your nerve roots can be compressed, causing some of these symptoms. Um and to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam um but if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including um numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder incontinence, then we can look at some um imaging for the for the spine, including MRI. Um and so in terms of management of this, um we can try a couple couple of like conservative approaches first, so that includes taking NSAIDs uh for the pain um and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down um all the time, um perhaps like taking little breaks, uh stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well um during those breaks can help um, and as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy and they'll do some exercises with you and um slowly increase those exercises. Um and if those still don't work, we can try um steroids, steroid injections, um as well, we talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about 6 to 8 weeks. Does that sound OK?","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
How can I help you today?,"Um yeah hi, I brought I brought my 8 year old daughter here um because I've noticed that she's been quite wheezy um for the past four five days and now she has a slight cough, um sounds like she's a little short of breath, so I just wanted to get things checked out."

"Nothing like that, OK, and has it been fairly steady since then? Or has it been fluctuating?",It's been fluctuating.
"OK, but it hasn't really gone away in the sense that you're still concerned coming now four days later?","Yeah, it's just it would, she would have these these uh episodes, but it would resolve on its own and then she would, you know go back to doing some sort of activity and then she would have all these symptoms all over again, but when she rests um then it goes away, so I wasn't really sure, too sure what to think of it. But now I think it's important to get it checked out, so here we are."

"So that's just in the last few days. But just to clarify, I do get short of breath here and there sometimes I have to use puffers, but the last few days I've just been really short of breath, even even if I walk a little bit after like sit down and, can't really catch my breath.","OK. Alright, and do you get short of breath when you're laying down?"

"Uh, yeah I was just wondering what this can be.","Yeah, you know it sounds like you have a cough and shortness of breath, and both of these things you've had for a while, but now they're getting worse and based on your past history of COPD I would say this sounds like a COPD exacerbation. So for that we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC, electrolytes, your kidney function, ABG’s, as well as like a chest X Ray. And basically we should treat it we're going to take your oxygen saturation an give you some extra oxygen if you need. We’ll continue to use your bronchodilators an and in addition to both of that will also give you some steroids as well as antibiotics. And just to prevent any infections or if you already have it then it can help with that as well. And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid will also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?"
That sounds good. Thank you.,"OK, yeah, no problem."
What brought you in today?,"Hi, um so I've had this terrible fever for the past three days um and just before that I had a stuffy nose um and I had a sore throat, well I still do, um and it's just not going away, so I thought I should just come in and see if I have covid or what it is."

"OK, how's he doing?",Uh the same as me.
OK. And have you had any covid swabs recently?,No.
"OK, and aside from the weekend hike, have you been mainly self isolating or?","Uh yeah, just me and my husband at home."
"OK, and do you leave the house for work at all?","No, I work from home."
"OK, sounds good. So you have some muscle aches, little bit of fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, do you have any difficulty swallowing?","Uh no, it just hurts."
"OK, so you're still able to swallow food, swallow liquids?","Yes, that's right."
It doesn't feel like anything is going down the wrong way or have any coughing after you swallow?,No.

"Sounds good, now we've already talked about kind of past medical issues. Moving on, I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam. But before I do that, do you have any questions for me? Anything else you feel I should know?","No, do you think I have covid?"
"It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out, so we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what. Obviously with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So it sounds like if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So just while we're trying to investigate, work this up further, I want to have you and your husband self isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gotten your flu shot this year?","No, I haven't."
"So it's also a possibility it might be influenza, just the seasonal flu. But until we, I suppose rule out covid, it'd be best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious for the meanwhile.","OK, sure."
"Alright, well I'm going to go talk to the Doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you, OK?","Alright, great thank you."

"So it does sound like it could be related to diabetes where what happens is you get like a peripheral neuropathy overtime and you can lose sensation to your feet in a glove and stocking distribution, which sounds like the history history you're saying today with having sensation reduced on your feet and also your fingertips as well.",Mmmm
"Where you lose sensation and you can't feel pain. And so But other things to consider could be. Possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that, but I would be much much lower down on the differential. And. So to regain sensation I think. Really, the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves, and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and. Trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can, making sure that the. There aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing. If things are not healing, it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis, which will prevent wound healing. And so if there are any, is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out. So feet hygiene is extremely important. As we're working on improving the diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol could could also help as well.","OK OK, thank you."

"OK, when are you straightening it out all the way OK, But no pain with shoulder movements and full range of motion?","No, no pain with shoulder."
OK. And how about pain with pronation and supination?,With pronation it hurts.
"OK, at the medial side?",Yes.
"OK and how about with wrist. So with resisted uh, yeah, wrist flexion?",Wrist flexion yeah. That hurts too.
"OK, and then how about if you passively extend your your wrist as far down as as you can go?",Down uh yes. That hurts too.
OK. And is there any numbness or tingling anywhere?,"No, no, no numbness or tingling."
"OK. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention?","No, that was that. What do you think I have and how can I fix it?"
"Yeah, so it. It's certainly it it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow having pain there over the last several months and some of the physical exam maneuvers, such as like passive wrist extension, resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow this could be a medial epicondylitis or a tendinopathy in that area. And so this is typically treated with activity modification, so this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that that cause pain. And using medications such as Advil and Tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can learn from a physiotherapist or or on your own as well. And also other things that that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury. Um or yeah, or the other thing to be considering is and ulnar ligament injury and so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there.","OK, that sounds great. Thank you."

And yeah, I'm just scared of having to, you know, go on oxygen or like just not being able to breathe at one point."
"Yeah, for sure. So we will try to do a good job working you up for everything that we think it may be. And right now, it sounds like it could be pulmonary fibrosis either like you know an autoimmune process or triggered after like an infection that you may have had in the past. We will definitely also look into see if it's perhaps a lung cancer, asthma and you mentioned you don't smoke so we don't think it could be COPD but we'll also test for that in case all everything else comes back negative.","OK, sounds good.

"OK, uhm so uh, the next steps for now, I think, will be to, uh start, we'll get a physical exam in and your vital signs and get some investigations. It is sounding like a COPD exacerbation with the increasing and the change changing sputum. The increasing frequency of cough and the exertional shortness of breath as well, along with wheezing and kind of this chest discomfort that you're experiencing. And so, uh, this will require some antibiotics as well and depending on the severity of symptoms, possibly some steroids as well to help with the inflammation.","OK, that sounds good. Thank you."

Like did you uh go like leg first or was it, did your um, kind of like the mechanism of your fall, did you break the fall at all with your arms?","Uh no, I didn't break, it kind of, so I was kind of uh, I feel like when I was slipping it was at first my leg was hyper extended but it kind of just felt like it snapped and it went straight down, so there was some kind of twisting as well as some hyperextension.

"OK, yeah, um do you notice any obvious like breaks in the skin?","No, there's no breaks in the skin but like when I fell like I, I can definitely see like the bend, there is like a bend in the bone, so I definitely do think it's broken."

"No, OK. Uh any bruises in the area?","Yeah, the whole area seems bruised up and angry."
"OK. Um does uh, besides the bruising and the misalignment, do you notice any other obvious deformities, any muscle atrophy in the area?",No.

"OK um and then I'm gonna try to get you to do some movements, um can you move your right leg at all, like can you flex and extend your knees?","No, not not at all like I I'm I'm too scared to try."
"OK, and how about weight bearing, are you able to stand up at all on that leg?","No, I just I just got time to call the ambulance, I knew I knew it was just not possible."
"OK, alright, um I guess those were all the questions that I had for you. Um I think you may have a tibial fracture. So we'll start with some X Rays um to be sure and to try to take a look at like where the fracture is and how we can approach that. Um because everything is swollen and angry down there, we'll probably try and um apply a splint um until the swelling goes down. And then um we can uh refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon for a surgic, for the surgery itself. So that could um involve, like uh  you know them doing like and intramedullary nail, plates and screws, and um like some sort of fixation. Um but after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely, uh so in that period um we can talk about like pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion. Does that sound OK?","That sounds good. Alright, thank you so much."

"OK, and how long does it last?",I would say it lasts up to an hour every time I'm out in the cold and then once I come back in. So I'd say it lasts at least one hour.
"OK, does anything else make it worse, like dust? You know, laying down anything like that?","Sometimes when I'm near dust, sometimes when I'm running during gym class, increased activity does make it worse."
"OK, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of your breathing difficulties, is it more like a burning kind of feeling? Is it like you can't catch your breath? What does it feel like?",I think it's more just a I can't catch my breath and it feels like my my throat is just kind of like closing off and I can't take deep breaths.
"OK, yeah, that's scary. And one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your shortness of breath?","It can get up to I would say like an 8 at times. It can get pretty scary. And sometimes, like I feel like heaviness in my chest too when it happens."

"OK, any weight loss?",No no.

"OK. Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself?","Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow."
"Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound?","Yeah, that that sounds um good, thank you."
So I understand you're having some chest tightness?,"Yeah, it's uh, for the last maybe three days, um it's not really pain, not in any specific spot, it just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in especially, and it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight like especially when I go for my walks, which I do everyday, uh I try to walk my dog. So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come and get checked out."
"OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?",I think it's staying the same.
"OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?","No, nothing in particular um yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady."
"OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?",Uh I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk.
"OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain?","No, there's not there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight."
"OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all?","Uh, no I can't say that I did."
"Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?","Uh I I feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath, um so yeah, yeah, I guess."
"OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?",Kind of just all over.
"OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say?","Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said."
"OK, so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable, if not worse, when you're going for a walk?",Exactly.
OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?,"Uh no like I feel a little more hoarse and like there's maybe some more phlegm, like I'm clearing my throat more, but I haven't actually been coughing."
"OK, any fevers?","No, can't say that, no."
"OK, any night sweats, so waking up and the sheets are soaked?",No.
Any chills?,No.
Any unexplained weight loss at all?,Nope.
"OK, and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?","Uhm, I mean I have asthma um so I've had some trouble breathing before, it, this feels feels uh different than other times. I I guess it could be related, but uh I don't know, this this feels a bit different, that's why I wanted to come in and get it checked out."
"OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?","Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one."
"OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?","Yeah, exactly like it's been a couple of years since I needed that, but I still I still take the daily one."
OK. And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either?,"No, I always take it um so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night, um for a while though sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it. Um so so lately I've been taking it everyday, but I've just been taking it in the morning."
"OK, uh, what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night? Have you just been doing well without it?","Exactly, like I haven't needed the rescue one in a few years and even when I was just taking it in the morning, I I haven't had any problems."
"OK, understood. And then have you had, I should have asked, do you work currently?","Uh I I, I'm a financial advisor, I'm like semi retired so I do some stuff from home."
"OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?","I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah."
"So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning, but it's noticeable?","Exactly, yeah."
"OK. Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?","Uhm, I have uh high blood pressure, I don't really see my doctor very much, I just am on um medication."
"OK, how about we just talk about your medications a little bit? What are you taking currently?","Uh I take the, uh, salbutamol."
Yeah.,"That we talked about, and I take um Ramipril."
Yep.,"And, uh, sometimes a Tylenol if you know, if I have a headache or something, but not very often."
"OK understood, so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else?","No, no."
OK. Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?,"No, nothing major, just the asthma. But you know, like I said, it's been a few years since it has bothered me."
"OK, got it, and just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke at all?","No, never."
"OK, so no smoking, any other recreational substances, drugs?","Oh no, no. I mean I I have um you know a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that."
"OK, got it. Any allergies that you have?","Uhm no, no, like I, uh, when I was younger I got some seasonal allergies sometimes in the springtime, but other than that, I I like I, it's really been uh many years since I've noticed that."
"OK, and so nothing new in the environment? You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog?",Exactly.
"OK, so sounds like you're pretty much staying the course last little while, just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness, and aside from that, seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors, but you've kind of been limiting the, some of the medication you're taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much.","Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough."
"OK. Alright John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next. Does that sound good John?","Sounds great, I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart."
"No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?","Sounds great, thank you."
"No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, I'll be back with you in a moment.",Thank you.
So I understand you removed insects from your leg earlier today?,"Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well."
"OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?",Yeah.
"OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?","It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much."
"OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?","No, this one, this one's pretty small."
"This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?","I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous."
"OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?","No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash."
"OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain?",No.
Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?,"No, no, I've been fine."
"OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?","Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else."
That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?,"Uh no, I didn't, no."
"OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?",Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.
"OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?",We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.
"OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?","No, no. I've been pretty healthy."
"OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?",Uh just for my cholesterol.
"OK, are you taking and medications for that?","Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one."
"OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?",Uh no.
So no drug allergies?,No.
"OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?","Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked."
OK. So no headaches?,No.
Nothing like that?,Nothing like that.
"OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean?","No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out."
"No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK?","Great, thanks."
What brings in here today?,"Hi there, I've just last night I was, I went for a run and I twisted my ankle. I think I stepped on something and it it really hurts."
"OK, and so when did you have the injury?",It was just yesterday.
OK.,Yeah it was just just yesterday that it happened.
"OK, and do you remember if you twisted it so you twisted your ankle, like did did it twist inwards or outwards?","Inwards yeah, I feel like I inverted my ankle."
"OK. And, so since then, were you able to stand up and or were you not able to bear any weight?","No, I was able to, uh, kind of finish the I I I just finished the walk. I was able to walk home 'cause it didn't hurt that bad immediately. It was a bit painful, but the pain really started a few hours later and has been pretty much constant ever since."
"OK, OK so it kind of got worse over time over the last day?",Yeah.
"And do you notice any kind of bruising, redness, swelling, any skin changes?","No, I haven't really noticed I uh, really, any swelling or I or or skin changes. Yeah, no skin changes and no swelling."
"OK, and how would you describe the pain? Is it like a dull, aching pain or sharp stabbing pain?",Dull and achy.
OK. OK. And has this happened to you in your ankle before?,"I'm I, I feel like I've maybe I I've done something like this when I was younger, maybe playing basketball or something like this when I was a kid, I twisted my ankle before."
"OK, and does this pain just stay, where's the pain exactly on the right side of your ankle or on your left, like interior side?",It's on the right kind of outside of the ankle.
"OK, and which ankle is this just to clarify?",On the right ankle.
OK so so it hurts on the right side of the right ankle.,"Yeah, exactly."
"OK, and does the pain radiate or move anywhere in your feet?","I can kind of feel it around on the the sole of my foot as well, but mostly on the outside though."
"OK, and is there anything that makes the pain better or worse?","Alright, it gets worse really to if if I move my ankle or if I'm standing on it."
"OK, and anything that makes it better?","Alright, just if I rest and avoid moving it."
"OK, have you notice any fevers or chills?",No.
"OK, any pain in any other joints besides your ankle?","No, just my my right ankle."
"OK, any appetite or weight changes?","No, I've been I've been just training for this race coming up, so I mean I've been just trying to work on my fitness a little bit, but my weight has been relatively stable."
"OK, any weakness in your right right extremities or any kind of numbness or tingling sensation?",No numbness or tingling and no muscle weakness either.
"Ok, right. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?","I'm uh, I had diarrhea a few months ago and I was given a fluoroquinolone as an antibiotic."
"OK, that's two months ago. OK. And any medications that you're on currently?",I I take a Vitamin D and some other vitamins too. Vitamin A as well I guess that just helps my my skin and and then the vitamin D for my my bones.
"OK, any allergies to medications or any environmental issues?","No allergies, no."
"OK, any hospitalizations or previous surgeries?",No.
"OK. Any family history of any musculoskeletal conditions, any rheumatological conditions. Anything that you know of?","My grandparents have arthritis, so and my like my dad had had gout before."
"OK, and do your grandparents have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, do you know?",I think osteo yeah osteoarthritis.
"OK, and do you currently work?","I do, yeah, I work as a software engineer."
"OK, and what's your living situation like currently?",Right now I'm actually just living alone in a in an apartment.
"Ok, and do you smoke at all?","No, never I can't with the with all this like training for yeah at the race and stuff like that."
"OK, that's good. Any recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that before?","No, I've never used anything like that in the past."
"OK, and how about alcohol?","Uh rarely I'll have maybe a glass of wine like once every couple of months, but it's pretty infrequent."
"OK. Alright, so I just have a few questions. Right now over your right ankle, do you have, so you mentioned you don't have any swelling, but do you notice any kind of redness or warmth at all?","No, nothing like that."
"OK, and if you press down on your ankle, does it hurt a lot?","Uh a little bit of pain now that right, uh, like outside, but it's not uh, it doesn't hurt that bad. Yeah, I'll say no."
"OK, and if you kind of, uh, are you able to move your ankle at all?","I can, yeah I can move it around a little bit. I'm trying to avoid that though, just because it it does hurt, but I can move it around."
OK. And are you able to stand up and walk or are you not able to do that right now?,"I can, yeah, just for short periods of time 'cause it's just 'cause of the pain, but I can walk on it."
"Ok, yeah, so definitely what we'll do is we might need to get like a proper physical examination done to make sure there is no fracture. Most likely though, it seems that this may just be an ankle sprain uh, due to you inverting your ankle the other day. Uhm, what we can do is usually we just immobilize the ankle and then recommend applying ice. You can take some NSAIDS like Advil for pain to help you. And it should it should get better on its own, with some physiotherapy later on as well. However, if we find that on physical examination you are having significant pain on palpation or any kind of bony pain, we might also require you to get an X Ray of the right foot and ankle, as well as just your lower leg. So yeah, we'll have you come come in in person and then go from there and see if you need an X Ray.","OK, that sounds good, thank you."
I was wondering if you could start by telling me what brought you into the emergency Department.,So I came to the emergency Department because I've been having pain in my chest.
"OK, where is the pain located?",I would say it's like the whole pretty much the left side of my chest.
"OK, and when did this pain start?","So I think it started just around 2 hours ago. I actually was riding my bicycle and just fell off on, kind of just slipped and I think I fell on that side like when I the impact was right on my chest and since then it's been really painful."
"OK I am how would you describe the pain, sometimes people will use words like burning dull, achy.",I think it's more like someone is just stabbing me and then whole left side area.
"OK, and um. Anything that you've been doing that's that's made the pain worse?","If I. Think I have to take really really slow and shallow breaths. If I try to take a deep breath it just really hurts like taking those small, smaller breaths helps."
"OK, and do you feel the pain anywhere else, or is it just on the left side of your chest?","No, I would say just on the left side."
"OK, and has the pain been getting worse, staying the same or getting better?",I'd say over the last two hours it's been getting worse.
"OK, and do you have any other associated symptoms?","Uh, like I think I I'm having. Also maybe it's just because I'm trying to breathe slowly, but I feel like I can't catch my breath."
"OK, um has anything like this ever happened to you before?","No, no. I mean, I've never had any pain in my chest before."
"OK are you, did you have a loss of consciousness when you fell off your bike?","No, I got right back up. I just just had the pain."
"OK, so any injuries to the head?",No.
OK.,That's fine. I was wearing a helmet.
"OK, excellent and any headache right now?",No.
"OK, how about any fever chills?","No, I feel I'm fine."
Any nausea or vomiting?,Nope.
Do you feel as though your heart's racing?,I would say like in the last hour a little bit more so than usual.
OK. Any skin changes or or rashes you've noticed?,"Besides, just I got some scrapes here and there on my hands, but nothing else."
"OK, and do you have a cough?",Nope.
"OK, and any recent infections?","No, I've been pretty pretty healthy recently. No, no cough or no infections."
"OK, and uh, any dizziness?",Um no.
"Alright, and I know you mentioned the few scratches on your hands, but any other injuries?","Oh no, I I think I got a pretty lucky."
"Oh, OK. And any alcohol or drug intake prior to falling off your bike?","Oh no, no, I was completely sober. No no drugs or alcohol."
"OK, and any weakness or numbness or tingling that you noticed?",Um no nothing like that.
"Alright, and, when was the last time you had anything to eat or drink?","I just had some cereal and, um, just some chocolate milk around breakfast time but nothing else."
"OK, and how many hours ago was that?",I would say around 3 hours ago.
"OK. Um, and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?","Uh, not other than just a hay fever, but nothing nothing else. I have like a lot of allergies."
Any allergies to medications?,"Oh, just sometimes when I take like a nasal spray I think I might have an allergy to the steroids that they give me and sometimes also some of the antihistamines I think I get some allergies from them."
"OK. Uh, and any hospitalizations?","No, never."
Any surgeries?,Nope.
OK. Anybody in the family who have any illnesses?,Just my father. He has type 2 diabetes but nothing else.
"OK, and how do you support yourself currently financially?","Oh so I work just as like a mechanic just in the city and currently I just have myself to support. I live alone in an apartment, so I'm doing fairly well."
"OK, and do you smoke?","I smoke around like I'd say 2 and a half to 3 packs per day. I know it's. Yeah, I have tried quitting before, but I would say I've been smoking since I was 18."
"OK, and do you smoke marijuana?","No, no, no marijuana, no other drugs."
"OK, and do you drink alcohol?","Yeah, it's just like sometimes on the weekend. I'll just have a beer or two while watching the game, but not nothing regular."
How may I help you?,"I just came in here today, I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. Just in my left shoulder."
"OK and when, when did this pain start?","It started 5 days ago but it became pretty bad and I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple weeks, but it got really bad just this week."
"OK, did you have any trauma to the shoulder like any any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain?",Uhm I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months and lifting weights and things like that. But just this week I wasn't even really able to do that either.
"OK, when you were lifting weights like a few days ago like was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain, where it got worse kind of like right away.","I think it was more progressive, but five days ago I do feel that there was like just. I was having some pain before that, but then I just noticed while working on I I started having more pain. But yeah I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though."
"Oh OK, but it yeah it was progressing and then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like.",Maybe like I did increase my weight like in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain with the increase last week.
"OK, I see an in the left shoulder do you feel the pain at the front at the sides or or back?","It hurts, particularly like in the front part of the shoulder."
"OK, do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else?","Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really."
"OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp, or is it a key?",It's more achy.
OK.,But but certain like some movements so it can get like kind of sharp.
"OK, and has there been anything that has made the pain worse?","Uhm, if I just if I carry anything with my left arm or if I have to lift anything or place it on my shoulder like it really hurts."
"OK, and have you done anything that's made it better?","I just like resting it, not carrying anything. And trying not to lie on my shoulder."
"OK, so you're sleeping on the others on the right side then.",Yeah.
"OK alright, how would what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10.","Uhm, if I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a two or three, but if I try to carry anything it goes up to like probably like a 7."
"OK, uh, and um. Do you do any repetitive kind of like overhead activities? Things like playing basketball or just lifting things like above your head at the gym?","Um not recently just just like normal weight exercise, maybe with the bands I do some overhead exercises, but in terms of sports I I play or I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said it, I might have overused that shoulder, but that's that was like a couple of years back so I thought it must have healed by now."
"OK, so previous overuse injury of the left shoulder?",Mmmm
"OK, and uh. I'm have you had any trauma to the shoulder?",Um no not that I know of.
"OK, have you had any fevers or chills?",No.
Have you had any night sweats?,No.
"OK, have you had any skin rashes or or skin changes?",No.
OK so even over the area you haven't noticed any redness or like soft tissue swelling?,No.
OK. Have you had any chest pain?,Nope.
"OK, how about any shortness of breath?","No, not that I've noticed."
"OK, have you had pains and any other joints?","No, just my shoulder."
"OK And. Um, Have you had any recent infections or or symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat or even a cough?","No, nothing like that."
"OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?",Um nope.
OK. And um. How has your sleep been these past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side?,"Yeah, it's been pretty painful like I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go on to my left side."
"OK, so you're getting worse thing a pain at night?",Yup.
OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength in your arm?,"Um I do you feel that there might be some less strength in my left arm, but it's I'm not really using it much so it's hard to tell."
"OK,  And how about a range of motion. Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to like, scratch your head and back?",It does hurt like when I try to lift my arm up.
"OK, so it sounds like a range of motion is decreased?",Mmm
"OK, and have you had any altered sensation of your arms being like numbness or tingling?","No, I haven't felt any of that."
OK. Um and have you had any changes to your bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea?,"Nope, nothing like that."
Have you had any abdominal pain?,Nope.
And have you had any urinary problems?,No.
"OK, and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?","Uh. No, I've been a pretty healthy actually just just that overuse injury like two years ago."
"OK, great and do you have any allergies to medications?",No.
"OK, do you take any medications regularly?","Just recently I've been taking a lot more of the Advil, but that's about it."
"OK, I and have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries?","No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations."
"OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like who you're living with, and whereabouts?","Yeah, so I'm living with with my wife in a small condominium in downtown."
"OK, and are you working currently?","Yeah, I'm working as a real estate agent."
"OK, uh, and do you drink alcohol?","Rarely just on some occasions, but not regularly."
No. OK. How about smoking cigarettes or cannabis?,"No, I've never smoked."
Do you use any recreational drugs or have you in the past?,Nope
"OK. Um. And so so the next part, just for the physical exam. So do you have pain with shoulder AB duction.","Uhm yes. So just to yeah, I do have some pain. Especially from. Yeah yeah pain throughout AB duction."
"OK, is there any like pain that's like parts of that that range of motion that are more painful for you?","yeah, so probably from 60 degrees to 120 degrees is more painful."
OK. And. If your arm is outstretched and your thumb pointing down so your arm is internally rotated does that give you pain?,"Yeah, if yeah, not not just like that, but if you were to like press down on it it the internal rotation does cause a little bit of pain."
"OK. OK, so it sounds like a positive jobes test and a positive Neer's test as well as a painful arc for your shoulder. And is there pain to palpation?","Uh. Just to, yeah, definitely just at the front of the shoulder there is some some pain over with palpation."
"OK, that sensation is normal, reflexes are normal and strength is slightly reduced as well. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check on the physical exam as well. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today that I maybe forgot?","No, I think that's it."
"OK, um so based onI know that the symptoms today along with your age and prior history of an overuse injury of the left shoulder, it certainly raises concern of having a rotator cuff tear or um a rotator cuff impingement syndrome and where there is inflammation there not necessarily actually a full tear of the muscle that's causing the pain. So, uh, those would be the two most likely things. Yeah, their rotator cuff tear or subacromial impingement syndrome. And so we were going to get an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures and possibly some other imaging such as an X Ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder.","OK, sounds good. Thank you."
What brings you in today?,"So I've been having just a worsening breathlessness. I've been also having a cough, and I think I might have also had a fever in the last couple weeks."
"OK, um so the breathlessness started six weeks ago, correct?",Yeah.
OK and then when did the cough start?,"I'd say around the same time the breathlessness started, so around six weeks."
OK. And then the fever?,The fever I've kind of had on and off in the last couple weeks. I would say two to three weeks.
"OK, OK um and do you, how often are you having this breathlessness?","Um I would say it's pretty much there most of the time. It sometimes gets worse when I'm exerting myself, but I think just baseline, I feel like I've been able to breathe less heavily than before."
"OK, so alright, and how long does it last when you do get it? Or is it just always there?","Uh, it's kind of just there, but then when it's getting worse like it lasts a couple minutes to, I would say like 10 to 15 minutes and then it goes back to like just the normal breathlessness."
"OK, and if you were to describe the quality of your breathlessness, would you say that it feels like a kind of like a burning feeling, like you're having a hard time catching your breath or does it feel like you're breathing too fast?","I think it's more I just can't seem to take like deep breaths.

"OK, and have you ever experienced this before?","No, this is like the first time I'm having this issue."

"Yeah, for sure. So the first thing we want to rule out is TB. Because you have recently moved to Canada from a country where it is, I believe it is endemic, so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with TB and how it presents so we just want to make sure it's not that because it is highly infectious and and we don't want it to spread. So, we can do like a AFB smear or I think they have other diagnostic work up for that too. So we'll do that first. If not, we can check to see if it's like another, another typical pneumonia, we can do a chest X Ray for that as well. If both of those turn out to be negatives, then we'll have to work you up further for other things, like COPD, or lung cancer. How does that sound?",That sounds good. Thank you.

"OK, so no bruises?","Uh no, no no bruises"
"OK. Do you notice any like muscle atrophy, any deformities or skin changes otherwise?","No, everything looks looks normal."

"OK. Um and then when you palpate your knee cap as well as um yeah, just if you could palpate just at the center of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?","No pain over the kneecap, that feels fine."
"OK. How about when you palpate kind of like the medial ligaments of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?","No, everything on the medial side feels feels normal and fine."

"OK, OK, and how about when you palpate uh that big muscle group on your thighs like the quadriceps?","That feels OK, no pain in the muscles."
"OK, how about like the patellar tendon?",Uh no pain there.
"OK. And then when you go lower below your kneecap, um when you palpate like the top part where the proximal parts of your tibia and fibula are, do you feel any pain there?","Uh, yeah, no pain there."
"OK, and now let's do some um movements with your leg. Um are you sitting down?","Uh, yeah, I am."
"OK, I'm gonna get you to stand up from a sitting position, does that, is that painful?","It is, yeah it's, I get a sharp pain if, when doing that."
"OK yeah, uhm how about when you um sit back down, does that hurt?","Um yeah, that hurts too."
"That hurts too, OK. Um and then how about when you flex your knee inwards, um so that your heel is touching your bum like does that hurt?","Uh like I, I'll get up, uh no that doesn't hurt, that feels OK."
"OK, how about when you extend your knee back out, straighten it all the way?","Yeah, that feels OK too if I'm just sitting and doing that, I can um, I can do that OK."
"OK. Um how about when you, so you're standing and then you uh you abduct your hip so you basically, um you flex your hip but laterally and you kind of bring it upwards so that it's almost, so that your your, the action is like you're uh trying to touch the ceiling.","OK yeah I um, it, if, it does feel, it feels like it's kind of pulling um like it feels tight when I do that uh like on that side, it's, I don't get the same sharp pain, but it's uncomfortable."
"OK, uhm, so I'm gonna try a special test, it's called the Ober test. So can I get you to lie on the side um with the injured knee?",Yep.
"OK, and then I'm gonna get you to flex your knee at 90 degrees and um abduct and extend the hip uh while your thighs maintain in line with your trunk. Um so I'm gonna get you to adduct your thigh, so bring it back towards you, the the median, um as far as possible.","Oh yeah, I can't really, it's kind of like stuck out there. It feels really tight if I'm trying to like bring it, bring it back down, my leg almost like floats up if I just leave it there."
"OK, so that is a positive Ober test. Um OK, so what it sounds like is you, it sounds like you have something called um iliotibial um band syndrome, so ITB syndrome, and basically that happens in um athletes, so depending on your like position, like how much you're using those joints um and like repetitive actions um of like knee flexion extension um kind of triggers that. And to treat it, uh we can try some conservative um things first, so the first thing would be um for you um to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more, so you're doing a lot of running, so maybe uh switching to things like swimming um for the time being can help with that. And then other things include ice or heating pads, uh taping and stretching, um and then if the pain is, if the pain uh persists, you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief. Um we can talk about other treatments as well, like physiotherapy because um it'll be important to kind of strengthen those muscles around that joint as well as um increase your range of motion, so we can do, we can put in a referral for that. Um and if none of those work, we can also discuss um some other things like ultrasound therapy or like muscle stimulation, um shockwave therapy, and then eventually if none of those other things work, we can discuss surgical management but uh it's rare that it ever gets to that point. Does that sound OK?","It does, yeah, thank you so much."

Uhm, actually now that I think about it, it's it's kind of there even when I'm like breathing normal, but it's not as bad.

Any alcohol?,"Alcohol, just, uh, probably just on the weekends or have a couple of beers."
"OK alright, uhm. So, I guess from the symptoms that you've described, it sounds like you likely have a condition called acute rhinosinusitis where you have inflammation of the sinuses in your face and potentially some inflammation in your nose as well, and often it's caused by a virus and it usually gets better in a couple of weeks. And the best thing to do is just conservative management. Try to rest and, if, if you know taking any medications, over the counter medications is helping you feel better, if you feel like Tylenol, sort of reducing some of that pressure or if doing a, taking a steam bath is sort of helping relieve that pressure, try those. Drink a lot of water to try to sort of lear out all that mucus that's that's building up. I'll also do a physical exam and talk to my attending and confirm all this information with him and we can go from there.","Great sounds good, thank you."
"Uhm, also sorry before for in the call because the symptoms are started recently and they do uhm, overlap with some of the symptoms that if patient with COVID might have, it might be a good idea to get a COVID swab done as well, so we'll do that today and you would have to quarantine and stay away from the people at your home as well, until the results are out, and then if it's positive, public health will let you know what to do.","Alright, sounds good.

"Yeah, certainly so right now the top thing on top two things on the differential would be gout or pseudogout they do have some risk factors for that, including a diuretic medication as well as alcohol and obesity are all risk factors for it. However, you also had a knee injection a week ago, which could predispose to an infection. So gout and septic arthritis are the two things that I am thinking about an, so we'll do a knee aspiration and send that off for some investigations and that will help us determine which what the cause is and we can choose the appropriate appropriate treatment.","OK, sounds good."

"Yeah, so yeah, we always recommend cutting down or quitting smoking whenever, whenever we see patients who are smoking, especially like, you're fairly young. And you know your grandfather had history of lung cancer with smoking throughout the year. So as early as we can quit smoking, the better for the long term health of your lungs, but whenever you're thinking of quitting, or if you want any more resources about quitting, just let me know. We can set up a separate appointment for that.","OK, that that sounds good. Yeah, maybe maybe next appointment we can talk about that."

I'm really concerned about the the blood that I brought up like I mean is this cancer or, uh, uh tuberculosis like one of those tuberculosis infections that I heard about while I was away?"
"Yeah, so definitely, a cancer is pretty unlikely because you're fairly young and you've just recently started smoking, but one of the things that we're concerned about is your recent travel history being in close quarters. So definitely we need to get a chest X-Ray and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis. And then based on the results, we might have to start you on like a whole antibiotic regiment if it does come back as tuberculosis. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll get those investigations done first and then we'll go from there.","OK, thank you."
"We'll also get some blood work done as well, so that'll be done before your next appointment.","Alright, that sounds good. Thank you."
I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you in to see us.,"Yeah, so I just came in. I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in the sputum that I'm producing. Before it just used to be like white but now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months occasionally some streaks of blood."
"OK, and the cough started two years ago.",Yeah.
"OK. And, it's been gradually getting worse over that time?","Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature."
OK. And how much sputum are you bringing up an in a day?,"Probably like a, a couple teaspoons."
"OK, and uh, is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up?","Uh. In this it's kind of mixed into the sputum. I would say like, but it definitely is red."
OK. And how much blood would you say that you're you're bringing up would be teaspoons? Or a Cup? Or?,"No. It's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant, it doesn't feel like the whole production of the sputum, but just like little streaks that I've noticed."
"OK and um is the cough worse, at any particular time of day?","Um, it definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities and then also when I get like some viral infections. But other than that, it's pretty much always there."

"OK, great um. What did you do previously for for work? Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like of that nature?","Oh yes, I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think yeah, there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles.

"OK, how long have you been living where you you've been now?","So this this is like the one I'm living in is a new place, but before that, I lived in another apartment for around five years and that was a pretty old building."

OK um. Was there anything that you're worried that this could be?,"Um Yeah, just the blood I kind of got scared maybe I thought like you know what if it's a cancer? One of my friends had lung cancer and I I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about."
"Um, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show",Sounds good.
"OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into.","OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."

"OK, so you you you think you heard a pop at that time?","Um I'm not sure if I heard a pop. Actually, I think I might have though."

I I just actually probably started this past year. I used to. I used to workout a lot. In University and in my early 30s but then I stopped and this year I've kind of gone back into it.,"OK, well it's good that you're staying active. And um do you smoke cigarettes?"

"Not that I know of, no.","OK, now how about any autoimmune diseases?"
"Uh, no, I don't think so.","OK, so next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the at the arm. Compared to the other side, are you noticing any swelling, redness, or?"
"Yeah, any swelling or redness, I do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area, some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in that region. Uhm, I also feel like when I like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards.","OK, is this the mass or lump that I you were mentioning earlier that you kinda can notice in the in your right arm?"
Yeah yeah.,"OK, is there any temperature change, like does it feel warm on that side?"
Uhm I can't really tell if it's warm or not.,"OK, and you so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up so to flex it all the way up, or is a range of motion limited?"
"It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful and that I also can't like. I can't turn my arm, I can't supinate.","OK so yeah, so is that so you have reduced supination as well?"
Yeah.,"And how are your shoulder movement, are you able to like if you're lifting your arms straight out in front of you, are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head?"
Out like at the sides or in front of me?,In front of you.
"Yeah, the shoulder seems to be OK. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot.","OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement."
"There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that.","OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that?"
"Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions.","OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is."
Could you start with telling me what brought you in today?,"Hi, I've just been been so like weak and so tired, I just I can't I can't seem to like get off the couch, like I'll get up from my bed and go lay on the couch and then you know I might be able to get something to eat but I just I get so tired so fast and I don't know I don't know what's wrong."

I had to call my boss and say that I can't."
"OK, um have you had any like specific muscle weakness like in your legs or or in your arms? Or would you say it's overall like a general weakness?","It's just everywhere. It's it's not like I can't move. I'm just really, really tired."
"OK, and how, how have you been sleeping?","I mean, I've just been sleeping like all the time. I have been sleeping all night and then like I said, I get up and I go to the couch and like just fall back asleep."

A week and a half?,"Yeah, it's kind of like a very sharp, strong pain uh when I take a deep breath."
OK.,"But I don't notice it all the time, it's just, it's often when um I'm sitting and studying or when I'm walking, when I'm walking to school."
"OK, did you have any accidents or injuries around that time?","Uh no, nothing that I can think of."
"OK, did it come on suddenly? Or is it more gradual?","Yeah, it's uh, no it's it's pretty, it's pretty well, it seems the same each time.

"OK, so it's pretty, it's not consistent throughout the day, it only happens at certain times of the day?","Yeah, it'll come on for like 20 minutes like here and there."
"OK, anything that you think triggers it?","I don't I don't really know. Uh I was kind of worried um, I was kind of worried that it could be a heart thing, I I feel like it might it might be, it could be stress uhm but I'm I'm not really sure, my dad had a heart attack last year, he was pretty young. He's like in his 50s and it it just kind of scares me because now he's having these heart problems."
"OK, so these chest pains last for about 20 minutes, it only happens when you take a deep breath in, and after the 20 minutes, do they come and go? Is it something that gradually weans off, or is it fairly sharp?","It seems like it kind of goes away once I, once I'm at school and like talking to people and doing other things. It's kind of when I'm, I notice it when I'm on my walks when I'm alone or like when I'm studying alone more, like maybe I have it when I'm talking to other people, but I don't really notice it."
"OK, does it get worse with exercise?","Uh I don't think so. It just kind of, like when I'm walking to school, it kind of stays the same. I haven't done any strenuous exercise lately, 'cause I've just had so much uh schoolwork piling up."

"OK, is there anything special about the last couple of weeks that's made you more stressed than previously?","Uh I think just the the time crunch of having to to finish this. I've never felt like so, like there is so little time to do the work that I need to do."
"Got it. Have you ever felt this pain before, anytime in your life?","No, no, not before this."

"OK, and when you're pretty preoccupied, do you ever get the chest pain?","Um like when I'm really, when I'm work, like working with classmates or uh like thinking really like if I'm talking to someone else, I don't really get it or if I if I'm like working on a task with my hands, but it's when I'm walking and I am alone kind of with my thoughts or when I'm studying, that's when I when I get it."
"Understood and you said your father passed early from a heart attack, I'm sorry, but anyone else in your family either your parents or mum have any health issues?","Oh he's uh he's alive, like he had a heart attack and just now he has to see a lot of heart doctors.

"Uh, no, no, that sounds good.","OK so if you have someone there with you, or if you have a mirror, or if there's any way you can take a look at the back of your neck as well as the front of your neck um. Do you see any redness or swelling in that area?"
"No, I don’t.","No, OK. Do you see any muscle atrophy? Any deformities or skin changes?"

"Yeah, so there's there's no pain when I push on the like bones I can feel like so, actually on that that like C spine itself there's no pain, but like oh off to the side so on the muscles. To the sides or there's a bit of tenderness.","OK, so kind of like where, so there's pain on their trapezius and deltoid muscles?"
"Uhm. Uh. Yeah, more trapezius not so not so much deltoid and then also, um, like the the perispinal muscles.","OK, I see, alright. Uhm.

"It does, yeah.",It does but you're able to fully flex your neck.
"Yeah, I can touch my chin to my chest all almost uh but yeah, I'll get pain at the back of my neck when I do that and the front.",And the front? OK. And then how about when you extend your head all the way back so that you're looking at the ceiling?
"I’m able to do it still is a bit stiff and it's slow to get there, but again I I get pain at the back in the front of my neck when I'm doing this.","OK, OK, how about when you flex your neck to the side so that your right ear is touching your right shoulder?"
"Um yeah, I get there's a little bit of a pain in the muscles on the left side when I'm doing that","OK, and then how about when you do the opposite? Touch your left ear to your left shoulder so that you're laterally flexing your neck on the left side?"

"Uh no, that I just was wondering if I if you think I I don’t, needed an X Ray or like you think that anything is broken. Kind of like concerned about today, because of this pain.","Yeah. And for sure, um so right now it just to me it sounds like a whiplash injury and so kind of like low impact. But just to be certain, we can order an X Ray to rule out any fractures or dislocations. And in terms of like the management plan, for pain management you can rest, you can either apply heat or cold packs to your neck for 15 minutes every couple of hours or so. You can try some over the counter pain medications like Ibuprofen or Tylenol. And if it still doesn't get better, we can try like, we can try injections to the area to relieve some of that pain, but something else in conjunction we can try as physiotherapy and they'll basically help you with. Range of motion exercises and try to strengthen the muscles in that area and to improve your posture and normal movement. And that's kind of where we can start for now. And if it doesn't get any better, we can talk about alternative management plans, does that sound OK?"

"OK, that's it. OK, uh, any heart attacks in your family? Any other medical conditions?","Uh, no. Everyone's healthy."
OK and currently what is your living situation like?,"Yeah, so I live in an apartment nearby with my boyfriend."
"OK, and has there been any, have you moved there recently or how long have you lived there for?",Uh we've lived there for about four years now.
"Four years, OK. And has anything changed recently? Has there been any mold or new carpets that you guys got anything new in the house?","Uhm, I don't, I don't think so."
OK. And do you currently work?,"Yeah, I work as a a school teacher."
OK. And do you smoke at all?,"No, I don't."
Have you ever smoked?,"I did, yeah I, I smoked a pack a day up until just about a month ago. I made, it was a New Year's resolution to quit."
"Oh wow, well congratulations, that's it's definitely very difficult to quit. And if you need at all, any help at all with your transition at all, we can always bring it up in any appointment.","OK, thank you."
"Yeah. And in terms of recreational drugs, do you use marijuana or cocaine or any other recreational drugs?","Um, yeah, maybe I'll I'll smoke like one or two joints a week."
OK. And do you drink alcohol?,"Uh, yeah, maybe a bottle of wine on the weekends."
"OK. Uhm, so you go through like around a bottle every week?","Yeah, I would say about a bottle of wine on throughout the week, but usually don't really have any during the week, I'll usually, I guess, split the bottle between between Friday to Sunday sort of thing."
"OK. And in terms of exercise, do you find that you're getting adequate exercise throughout the week?","I tried to, I tried to run and go for walks but always trying to be a little bit more active."
"OK. Alright, so yeah those are all the questions I had for you today. Um, do you have any other questions for me?","Uhm, nope, that was it."
"OK, so based on what we talked about, it seems that based on your past history and the coughing that you're having right now, one of the things that we definitely want to look at is if you do in fact have asthma. Um, it can also be like viral upper respiratory tract infection, but we will do some pulmonary function tests for you and see if the bronchodilators just like you use the inhaler from your son if that helps helps you with your symptoms and then we can go from there.",That sounds great. Thank you.
No I think that's all just just was wondering what might be going on?,"Yeah, certainly, so a couple of things that it could be. One is that it can be common in this age group is something called transient synovitis. Where, which can happen in the hip where there's some inflammation and it causes some pain following a viral infection. And it sounds like she had a viral infection last week with the cough, fever and and runny nose and her. She was feeling a bit warm and maybe feverish today as well, which could be a sign with the lower kind of slightly elevated temperature, pointing towards transient synovitis, which is a condition that will be self limiting and can use anti- inflammatories to help with the pain such as ibuprofen, but also something that would be important to rule out would be is septic arthritis because it could could lead to damage of the joint, but this will be lower on the differential and then finally something to consider is Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. And, but this would be more of progressive  onset, but if she's not getting any better and or if she becomes more sick like develops a really high fever or a red hot swollen joint, then we'd be thinking more along the lines of septic arthritis and we want to reassess."
What brings you in here today?,"Hey, I'm I'm the mom of, of the patient. He's he's a kid, he has had, he just had a cough and stuffy nose for the past three days."
"OK, and so did they both start around the same time or one started before the other?","They started the same time. He's also had like these, these, his eyes have been like kind of red and watery as well."
"OK, and is he, what kind of cough is he having a dry cough or wet cough?",It's a dry cough.

It's kind of like this blotchy reddish, brownish like little dots. Kind of, it's not like, it's not raised, it's like flat."

"OK. So yeah, so, we'll, we'll be doing a couple we'll do a physical examination, I want to see examined with the rash looks like and there's many things that can cause a rash. There's uh viral infections that can cause some of the symptoms. The symptoms he's having mainly seen viral with a dry cough and runny nose. And then you can we have a rash as well. One thing I forgot to ask actually is is he fully immunized?","Um, he I guess he didn't get all his immunizations done earlier. He did get them a little bit later so we came from Syria as refugees. But I I'm thinking he got all his immunizations when he, uh, came to, when we moved to Canada."
"OK, and is he complaining of joint or muscle aches at all?",No.
"No, nothing like that, OK. Alright, so yeah, we'll do it like a full physical examination, and if it's more just a viral, it'll be something that we'll just have to monitor and do supportive care for. But if it's anything else we might need to do further investigations. OK, and we'll just do a COVID swab for him today as well as some of the symptoms overlap with COVID symptoms and you will get the results back in 24 hours to 48 hours and then further instruction from public health.",Sounds great.
How may I help you today?,"I'm just bringing my son today because he's been how many episodes where I'm eat hell gets all this coughing fit and become wheezy and become shorter breath and I mean after a period of time it goes away, but it's been happening every so often."
Does he still have these symptoms?,"Like right now he's OK. When the symptoms come on, they last for I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, 60 minutes or or even less. But yeah it happens maybe once or twice a week where and it's been going on for a, a couple of months now. Yeah, he actually had a viral infection like a few months ago and I thought it was just that. It leared up and then he's just had a few more of these episodes, but without those kind of symptoms so."
Hm? So all this started a couple months ago.,Yeah.
Do you find that there and you mentioned that it happens about one to two times a week? Is there anything specific happening at that time? Any triggers that result in these symptoms?,"Well I will say I think I like exercise. I find yeah like soccer practice. Yeah, after maybe, or even during a game, like when things are really intense. Yeah, I think during soccer I've I've kind of noticed it. And then at night time as well. It kind of randomly, he'll have this cough."
OK. So I guess it's do you feel like it's affected by cold weather as well or no?,"Um, maybe yeah, like if he yeah completely in the winter time. Like I know when he goes outside if he yeah he takes like a deep breath or something like that. He'll talk about having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in the cold weather."
"OK, other than the and I guess the cough. Is he coughing up anything, or is it kind of a dry cough?",It's dry.
OK. Does he have any like chest pain during these episodes.,"No, he hasn't said anything like that."
"Alright, any fevers?","No, he had a little bit of a fever at the that one time a few months ago, but he hasn't. So that's right. I think he had a some sort of illness then, but he hasn't had any fevers."
"I see. OK, any headaches?","No, he hasn't said anything like that."
OK. And how has he had any other symptoms so anything like racing heart or belly pain or muscle aches or any changes in his bowel movements or urinary symptoms?,"Uh no, I haven't heard him, uh, I complain about anything like that. I think I'll everything like that's been normal."
"OK. So when he has these episodes, how like how severe are they? So how difficult is it for him to breathe?","Ah, well, you certainly when it first starts, I mean for the first minute or two. Yeah, he that when I think particularly at soccer practice school have a really hard time catching his breath, but like he would, he stops playing and rests and really tries to make sure that he is I don't know, just trying to to breathe and it kind of goes away. He's been able to manage it OK."
"OK, alright and I have these symptoms that have interfered with his daily activities? Does he for instance, try to avoid soccer practice. Or does he have difficulties falling asleep at night?","Yeah, definitely wakes him up a few and every once in awhile at night and he does have to take it a little easier at soccer for sure. So yeah, I am thinking it is affecting him."
"OK. And otherwise has he been, has he had any medical conditions that he's been diagnosed with?","Uh, no, well he had some rashes when he was younger that he would get some some creams for, but that's mostly resolved now."
"OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries?","No, he hasn't had anything like that."
"OK, uhm. And just going back to his birth and your pregnancy, were there any complications at the time of pregnancy?","Um, there was a prolonged labor, I think, but he was delivered vaginally and at term"

"OK good has, was he kept in the in ICU for a couple of days after, was he sent home?","I think they, like he was kept for not an ICU he was kept for one day I think so just monitor for infection because it was like prolonged labor but he was OK. OK, so yeah we were able to go home."
"OK, and I, what was I going to say. Forgot what I was going to say. How yeah, how has this growth and development been? Has he been seeing his doctor regularly? Any concerns there?",Yeah he's been good with with growth. No concerns for that and his developments been normal as well. He's reached all of his milestones.
"OK, and is he going to school?","Yeah, yeah, he's been going to school. He hasn't really been, he hasn't missed well he's missed one or two days actually, because of the cough, like on nights that he just didn't sleep well, so in the morning he's just well, not not feeling good for school so he has missed a couple of days over the last few months."
"Okay. And does he, is there any other any conditions that run in the family? Including things like asthma or eczema, or allergic rhinitis or allergies.","Yeah, sister does have some bad allergies. Her nose runs all the time and she also has that asthma. His sister uses and a daily inhaler and then also W1."
"I see. OK, and uh. How are things at home is he, is he doing well otherwise? Like at school and things like that, any stressors in his life?","No, he's been doing, uh, he's been doing well at school. He likes math and that that's been going, well."
"OK, great. Has he ever tried any puffers?","No, he hasn't actually."
Has he been on any medications?,"Um, he he has not."
Any allergies that he has?,"Not that I'm aware of, but I I think he might. I mean so like environmental or I don't know, something. He does get symptoms like a runny nose and itchy eyes sometimes, but usually go away pretty pretty quickly and he doesn't fuss about it too much so, yeah so."
"From the symptoms that you've described so far, it sounds like he might also have asthma, but we will obviously have to do some testing and confirm that. Uhm, and also, it's given sort of the results, or even just like giving his symptoms, prescribe some buffers to help with those symptoms. Clearly it's affecting his life. He can't go to school or can't participate in soccer, or sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, and that's not good. So, we'll we can be prescribed some puffers and see if those help and also get some testing done. Do you have any other questions for me?","Uhm, No, yeah I was just wondering about, so like the wheezing and all of that could be with from asthma too?"
"Uhm, yeah, I would think so, but again, we'll get the testing done and see if there are any other, any other causes.",Ok.
You said the wheezing sort of lasts only 30 to 30 minutes to an hour and then gets better?,"Yeah, I don't notice that any other times."
"Yes, it's possibly, I mean, I would think it's asthma, but then we'll get the testing done and see.","OK, great, thank you."

"No, I haven't really noticed anyone being sick.","OK, OK, well those were the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
"No, I I was just wondering what this can be.","Um yeah, so the first thing we want to rule out as covid because a lot of your symptoms overlap with those of covid, so we'll take a swab and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound OK?"
"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.","OK. Great, no problem."
"Hi, what brings you to clinic today?","Hi, so I feel like I might have a bladder infection. I see a urologist because I've had some issues with like an overactive bladder for awhile. I've had a few bladder infections in the past and this is usually how how they feel. I feel like a little bit of burning when I go to the bathroom and I have to go like a lot right now. But then also sometimes it means that like it gets like this when I have my period and I don't have my period right now, but I you know I I could be getting it, but I also just don't wanna let it go keep going if I do have an infection. I just like rather get it like treated if I do."
OK understood. When was your last period?,"Um, like 2 weeks ago."
"About two weeks ago, are you fairly regular?","Like yes and no, it's. I'm I'm not super irregular, but I I sometimes have like basically it's like I alternate sometimes. I my cycles like 4 weeks and sometimes it's more like 5."
"Sorry, just clarify again, you're 30 years old?",Yeah I'm 30.
Ok are you on any contraception right now?,"Uh, no, I'm not."

"Ok, so you still have quite a, you have a, quite a bit of urgency to go?",Yeah.

"OK, so yeah, right now one of the main things we want to rule out, especially since you had the sudden shortness of breath today after a history of just recent discharge and the hip fracture or injury, and you're immobilized we need to make sure you haven't developed a clot that has traveled to your lungs. So we'll do a full physical examination and get some blood work done initially and then see if you require any medications for if you need thrombolysis for to break up the clot. We'll, we might do some imaging as well, so yeah, well, we'll just start with that, and then we'll go from there.",Sure.

OK. And and have you traveled anywhere outside the province?,"No been besides that, the family party last weekend, but I mean that was just here in town so. It was close by."
"OK, I guess I forgot to ask about a symptom. Have you felt that you've lost your sense of smell or sense of taste? Has it just been different?","Yeah, I said some actually now that you mention it right sense of smell has been different, which is kind of weird, 'cause I I don't have, everybody knows or I don't feel congested or anything. So yeah, but my taste has been OK."
"Good. Well, that's all the questions I had for you. Given that your symptoms sort of sound like you may have a viral or bacterial infection and seeing that you were, you had some exposure to to other people even though they weren't sick, it could, it could be that they, they had some sort of an illness that they could transmit that they weren't just showing symptoms at the time. We will get a covid swab done just to make sure that that's not what's happening. It could be that. And I'll recommend that you continue to, you know, take Tylenol and rest and take care of yourself and if your symptoms worsen or stay the same for long period of time, definitely come back or call public health to get some guidance and try to stay away from others and self isolate for the next couple of days or at least clear covid swabs back or your symptoms improve. Or the next 14 days. So that's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?","No, that sounds really good, thank you."

"So I wouldn't really say the neck, and I guess more of the the lower parts. Maybe like the middle of my back and...",I see.
And down.,"Ok and what kind of pain would you say it is, is it like a dull aching pain? Is it a sharp stabbing pain? How would you describe it?"
It's a dull pain.,"Dull pain, ok. Ok, and on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being the least amount of pain you felt in your life and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it?"
"It's about a four or five. I mean some days it can be better, but yeah, some days it can be worse.",OK and when did this start?
"I think this started about like four or five months ago. It's been going on, yeah, for probably about half a year now.","OK, and when it first started up, was there anything that caused the back pain? Like any kind of trauma or injury, anything that you can think of that might have led to this?"
"No, nothing that it's I I can think of. It's sort of it's come on so slowly like when I first started noticing the back pain it it was maybe like a 0 to a one. I didn't really notice it too much, but over these last 5, 6 months it has gotten has gotten a bit worse.","Ok, so it kind of came on progressively. Didn't just come on suddenly at some point?"
"Right, yeah, it's been getting worse.","Ok, and have you ever had any previous episodes that are similar to this?"

Uh no nothing that I can think of that really makes it any worse.,"Ok, and is your pain worse when you wake up in the morning or is it worse as the day progresses?"
"It's worse in the morning. It gets a bit better as the day goes on. I asked about it, an hour into the day, I feel my best. It takes a little bit of time to to move around a little bit first.","Ok, approximately how much time would you say after you wake up, the stiffness and pain goes away?"

"No cigarettes, no never.",Ok and you drink alcohol?
"Sometimes, yeah, I'll have a beer or two on weekends or or a cocktail with friends.","Ok, alright, so those were just some of the questions I had. Now I'm just going to quickly uh, ask some specific questions. So have you noticed any kind of swelling in the areas that you are having pain or redness or anything like that?"
"Uhm no, I haven't noticed really any any uh redness or or swelling","OK and no so, are you able to bend down and stand up straight or extend backwards so without pain or are you in any pain?"
"Uhm, I do get it. It's a bit stiff. Uhm I, uh, yeah, I'm not really too sure it's like, not really, it's more more more stiff.","Ok, and yeah, other than that, do you have any questions or concerns?"
"Uhm, yeah, I was just wondering, yeah, like like what what this could be possibly?","Yeah, so definitely what so this this seems like it started off like 3 months or six months ago, and it's been going on and it's happening in the morning. And how old did you say you were?"
Uhm I'm 26.,"OK, yeah, so uh, it seems progressive and you're getting some pain in your other joints as well and it's mainly from your middle to lower back. It can be multiple things that we would have to rule out. So you first you have a family history of psoriasis so it can be psoriatic arthritis. You don't have any other skins, changes or any other symptoms. It can also be since you have had a you were sick for months ago with a what might be gastroenteritis. It can be sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something called reactive arthritis - where you get this progressive pain in your joints and stiffness. And otherwise it can also be something called ankylosing spondylitis, which can present in men your age and it's kind of like a progressive, dull back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment or for that in person. And we will get some lab work done as well, as well as a X Ray of the of the spine and your sacroiliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with CBC, CRP and ESR. So those are just inflammatory markers as well as the rheumatoid factor antinuclear antibodies. Those are just some things that will test for different kind of rheumatological issues and to see if you have any arthritis. So yeah those are and then will also get an X Ray of your hands and knees since you're having pain there as well. So yeah, those are some steps that we'll take. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
"No, that that sounds, that sounds great, thank you.","Alright, yeah, so I will get in touch with you shortly."
"Sounds great, thank you.","Alright, take care."

"OK, any travel recently?","Uh no, I haven't traveled anywhere."
"OK um and well, let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview. Um so I'm going to get you to stand up from a sitting position. Does that hurt your back?",Um yeah it does. I I do feel a little bit of a a twinge there.
"OK, and where about specifically?","Kind of just, yeah, on the lower uh lower right side like more on the, more on the right side."
"More on the right side, OK. Now, if you have a mirror with you, or if you have someone there with you who can um speak to this, does your right side appear more red, swollen, or hot compared to your left side of the lower back?","Uh no, nothing like that."
"No, OK, and does it seem like it's more atrophied or do you see any deformities or skin changes in that area?","Uh nope, no deformities or skin changes."
"OK, um alright and I'm gonna get you to um bend down all the way and touch your toes if you can.",Um yeah I I can get part part way down.
"You can get partway down, does it hurt?","Um a little bit, I can feel it pulling and stretching, yeah."
"OK. Um alright, and then I'm gonna get you to uh like laterally flex to your right side. So kind of like you're doing an exercise um and you're just like bending towards that side.","Yeah, that hurts."
"That hurts, OK, how about the other side, the left side?",Yeah that hurts too.
"OK. Um and now I wanna get you to uh bring your knees up towards the ceiling. Does that hurt? One at a time, like your right right knee and your left knee.","Uh, not really."
"No, OK, how about when you um flex your knees backwards?",Nope.
And kind of point your knees towards the ground.,"No, no pain there."
"OK, so no pain on knee extension or flexion. Um how about when you point your toes to the ceiling?",Uh no pain there.
"OK so no pain on plantar flexion, how about when you point your uh toes to the ground?",No pain there.
"OK, so no pain on dorsiflexion, and then sorry I forgot to ask you earlier, do you have any sort of numbness in the groin area?","No, no numbness in the groin area."
"OK, so no numbness in the groin area, no weakness, no um changes in your bowel or bladder habits, including no incontinence, so uh no red flags?","Yeah, nothing like that."
"OK, OK, good um and, OK so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?","Uh, no I was just uh yeah, kind of wondering do I do I need any X Rays or like what what what's going on?"
"Yeah, so um what it sounds like right now is that you have something called mechanical back pain. It's pretty common and um it can be anything from your spinal joints to the discs to the vertebrate or soft tissue or muscle. Um and a lot of these can be caused by um hard activity at work, um like carrying heavy things um and then carrying them in like an improper position or something like that. Um and we diagnose that on history and physical exam, um but if after we try some management and treatment plans, it doesn't go away and it persists for more than eight weeks, we do recommend imaging, including an MRI. So uh in terms of management for right now, um modified activity at work, um some short term bed rest, uh very short term though um and bed rest is only really recommended if you have severe back pain and muscle spasms, um and you definitely shouldn't be doing that for more than like 24 to 48 hours, and physical activity can help, um so referral to physical therapy or physiotherapy um can help in rehab and they'll give you some exercises that you can try at home to kind of um strengthen those muscles. And then ice and heating packs um temporarily can help, uh medications like NSAIDs can help as well with the inflammation. Um so we'll try these things out and then we'll continue to follow up. Um yeah, did you have any questions or does that sound like an OK plan?",Uh that sounds like a good plan.
What brings you in today?,"I can't, I can barely breathe for like 2 days now and I've been coughing and been having like a little bit of pain in my chest."
"OK, the pain in your chest, uh can you point point out or can you describe the pain to me, is that sharp or is it dull?","Um, it's hard to say, I haven't really had this before. Um, it's more like it just kind of hurts just in the middle and it gets worse like when I cough and when I if I take like a really deep breath, it will hurt, yeah. Does that make sense?"
"Yeah, so the shortness of breath and chest pain, they occurred simultaneously right? On the same day, like 2 days ago?","Yeah, I mean now that I think of it, I maybe started coughing a little bit earlier than that. But when it got harder to breathe is pretty well around the same time that I started feeling more the pain."
"OK, alright so let's focus on the coughing first. Are you coughing up any blood at all?","Uh, no, I haven't noticed any blood."
OK. And how about sputum?,"I guess I guess it feels like there's some like mucus, I don't know kind, kind of like spit looking, but maybe like thicker than that."
"OK, is it yellow?","Yeah, yeah. Yeah well yeah, it's creamy yellow."
"OK, sure, and are you wheezing with the cough?",I I don't think so.
"No, OK, um and is it is your shortness of breath worse with exertion?","I haven't been doing much really 'cause I've just been so wiped out. Um, till probably I guess it's kind of, I'm really, you know, haven't been getting up very much. I'm normally really active like I I train for triathlons and I I'm not like a couch potato, right? And I feel like I've been just kind of sitting down."
"OK. Um, do you have the chest pain at rest as well, or is it just with the coughing?","Like if I take a deep breath I'll have it. But no, I don't think not not like right now. Not like just sitting here."
"OK. And the coughing, how often are you coughing?","Oh, like it kind of varies. I feel like I get up in the night kind of sweaty and I'll cough for for a while. And it it'll keep me up, and then during the day, it's like I might go, you know, a couple hours without, but then I'll cough and I'll kind of keep going for a few minutes so, it's a lot, like probably, yeah, I probably don't go more than like 2 hours without."
"OK, OK. And how far can you walk before you start feeling shortness of breath?","I mean, I haven't been walking very far. Like I I walked in here from the parking lot and that was fine, but I'm tired."
"OK, OK, and I just want to ask you some other questions. Um, Jessica, so have you had any fevers race recently?","I don't actually have a thermometer at home that works, but I like I said, when I've been getting up in the night coughing, I've been like really hot and sweaty. Kinda gross like feel like I just I feel like soaked and but yeah, I don't have a thermometer."
"Um, OK, so these night events that you're describing, are they more chills or night sweats?","Well, I don't know, it just feels like when you know when you're, I don't like when you're a kid and you get really sick and your parent tells you have fever like I don't have an actual temperature."
But do you feel hot?,"I feel hot, yeah."
"OK, OK. And have you lost any weight recently?","No, I mean I'd like to, but no, no."
OK and any changes in your vision?,"Uh, no."
Hearing?,No.
Smell?,No.
"Any, do you have like a stuffy nose? Runny nose?",Maybe a little little bit. It's been more the coughing that's that's bothered me. So I haven't thought that much about it.
"OK, sorry you said your nose was stuffy or runny?","So it's a little stuffy, maybe a little."
"OK, OK um, and have you had any like pressure behind your eyes in your head?",No no no.
"OK, no headaches?",No no.
No dizziness or fainting spells?,Like I feel tired but I haven't I don't know I haven't like fainted.
"OK, so you're tired, do you feel weak at all like you can't move a certain limb?","Oh no, that that's all fine."
"That's all fine, OK?",I haven't like wiped out like I said.
"OK, OK, um do you get this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing when you're laying down?","I mean, I've mostly been laying down lately, um, so yeah, like I kinda have it all the time."
"All the time? OK, but it's not worse when you're laying down or standing up?","Don't think it's worse, no."
"OK, and have you noticed any swelling?","Um, I don't think so, no."
"OK, any palpitations like you feel like your heart's racing?",No.
"No um, and then how about in terms of like your abdominal system? Any pain there?","Oh no, nothing. I mean it's like a little sore just 'cause I'm coughing all the time but yeah, but yeah, not not like, not anything like noticeable."
"OK, and then how about your stools? Have they been normal?",Yeah yeah.
"And then how about your urine, is that, has everything been normal from that standpoint?",Yeah yeah.
"OK OK um, and then, have you had any issues with breathing or coughing in the past?","No, I mean, I like I said I'm really active. I do a lot of like right, I've been like training for a triathlon, like I haven't had any problems before."
"OK, OK um, any any past medical conditions that you know of?","Uh, I got like I am a type 1 diabetic."
"OK, OK, have you ever, OK, have you ever had a pulmonary function test in the past?","Well, maybe when I was like kid or like a teenager."
And any recent chest X-rays ECG's any other investigations you've done so far?,"No, like I have been, I've been really healthy."
"OK, good and are you on any medications?","Um, like I take a, my insulin."
Yeah.,And like I take I take a statin. Is that what it's called?
OK. Is that because you have high triglycerides or like cholesterol?,"Uh, I, they just said 'cause I like had diabetes that I should probably start taking it."
OK yeah alright.,"There's no like a big problem. It was just, you know, my family doctor. I think my my dad has diabetes and he he he had heart problems so, like she also my family doctor knows my dad too so I don't know if that has something to do with it."
"OK. OK, and then yeah, I guess I will talk about family history since you brought it up. Any lung issues in the family?","Uh, not that I know of like."
OK.,Just I mean the heart like my dad had a heart attack. I don't know if that counts as like it's close to the lungs.
How old was he?,Um? It wasn't that long ago he was like in his 60s.
OK.,Yeah.
"OK. Um, I'm gonna name a few things and you let me know if this is in your history, OK, in your",
,"a few things and we kind of like to go through and make sure we're not missing anything. So in terms of like vascular stuff it could be something like like CHF or pulmonary embolism and that stands for congestive heart failure, but you're very young. You seem like you're very healthy, so that's probably lower on our differential obviously."
"OK, yeah hopefully.","An infection would be the biggest one right now with the cough with it seems like you have chills and night sweats. Yeah, so would have to do more in terms of taking your temperature, and see if you can do like more"
"low on the differential right now, so. Yeah, so um. So yeah, so for right now we'll start. We can start by doing some blood work. First I do a physical exam, of course. And then from there we would kind of do some blood work to see if your white blood cell count is high. And then we can do a chest X-ray to see if there is like a consolidation if there's pneumonia, or you know or, or anything viral? Um, do you have any questions?Anything that you wanted to add that I missed?","I don't think I don't think so, um yeah, I just hope I can get feeling better. Hope it's not anything serious like I I think yeah, I just hope it's like I hope like you said it's like I got like an infection or something and it will just be gone soon."
"Yeah yeah it does sound like it from the timeline like you started coughing two days ago, and then the difficulty breathing or shortness of breath also two days ago and then the chest pain just seems like it's from you coughing a lot.",It can do that?
Yeah.,"OK, yeah."
What brings you in to see us?,"So I've just been having this cough that I feel has just been getting worse, and I've also been feeling a bit short of breath for the last few months."

"OK, and how much sputum are you producing each day? Some, sometimes it's useful to think about like teaspoons or tablespoons.",I would say every time I cough like a teaspoon I probably have like. I don't know. Maybe 5 to 10 teaspoons a day.
"Uh OK, and is there any particular time of day that the cough is worse?","Um, not really. It's pretty, pretty much the same. Sometimes it is worse in the morning. Yeah, and sometimes it gets better when I go out for a smoke."

"OK, and have you had shortness of breath like this before?","Just throughout my life I've had asthma so when I am exercising too much or get exposed to like dust, sometimes get shortness of breath."
"OK. Has there been anything, um besides exerting yourself, that's made that either the cough or or shortness of breath worse?","Uh, over the last year like I've had a couple of chest infections. After going to the ER, they gave me some antibiotics. But yeah, when that happens it usually gets worse. The shortness of breath and the cough."
"OK, and uh, do your symptoms feel like any of those times right now?","No, I I don't feel like I have a fever and no other symptoms, just the shortness of breath and cough."
"OK, and have you been doing anything that's made it better?","I've been taking some Tylenol Cold, hasn't really helped too much. I've tried my inhalers, they sometimes help, but I've never had have this frequent of coughing and shortness of breath before."

"OK, yeah, and how often are you using both of those?",So the steroid one I am using pretty much every day but the salbutamol I found I've been using a lot more recently. I would say probably at least six to 10 times in a week.
"OK, um that reminded me I I forgot to ask. Have you notice any changes to your voice?","Um no, not really."

"Alright um so, that that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on history. Was there any, uh, any other questions that you had?","No, not really. Just wanted to get to the bottom of this."
"OK for sure so um we will run some investigations and likely get a chest X Ray because it's been a couple of months that these symptoms have been going on for. But I think it could be related to your smoking and most likely um Bronc, chronic bronchitis, but we can definitely will be looking into this, and then also with possibly some pulmonary function tests as well.","OK, sounds good."
,So can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in here today?
"Yeah, I've noticed I've had this pretty bad cough for like the last couple of days. A little bit worried. Wanna talk to someone.","OK, so started two days ago."
"No about what day is it today? Today is Wednesday. It started on Sunday, Sunday. I noticed it getting really bad.","OK, so it got really bad. Then it was it was it still present but not as bad before that?"
Yeah I think I had like a bit of like a raspy cough on like Friday but Sunday it was when I started getting nervous about it.,"OK so almost a week, it sounds like. And what exactly changed on Sunday that you made it worse in your opinion?"
So Sunday I started bringing I noticed like little spots of red kind of the the gunk I was bringing up.,OK.
"And I kind of ignored it, but the next day they were still there. I started getting fever just in I felt off, you know.","OK. OK, so that you first notice that on Sunday, were you bringing up sputum before that and it just didn't have these spots or did it, did that part just start on Sunday?"
"Sputum is kind of like the gunk up and bring it up? Yeah, it was. It's like this yellow custard, it’s got like well spots are red on it on Sunday.","OK, and before that did you have like the yellow custard without red? Or it all started at once all kind of started?"
It all started at once to be honest.,"Sorry, I know these are tricky questions, and you said that you've had some fevers. Can you tell me a little bit about that? When did that start?"
"So that started, the Monday really is when I first started. I never took my temperature. I just felt hot. You know that's been going on pretty much until today.","OK, did you ever feel like you were really shaky?"
"Yeah, I've been getting the chills, especially last two days.","OK. So over this time you've had this cough, have you felt like you've had difficulty breathing?"
"Not really, I feel a little bit winded doing things. I used to do like I take the stairs up to my apartment, but I have just happened really trying to exert myself that's been taking it easy so I haven't really noticed being out of breath.","OK, so probably if you were to get up and do a lot of physical activity you would feel worse."
"Yeah, I could, probably I can still take the two stairs up to my apartment, but after that I started to feel pretty crummy.",OK. Is there anything else that you can think of that makes it feel worse?
No.,Has anything helped it to feel better at all?
Bringing up gunk makes it feel better for a little while.,So you kind of just clear it up and that feels a little bit better?
"Yeah, I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit.","OK, have you felt a sore throat at the same time?"
"After an awful lot of coughing, yeah, it starts to feel a little raw.",Have you had a runny nose?

Yeah. Yeah I got pain kinda on the right.,OK. Have you ever have you ever had anything like this before?
"No never. Actually Doc, you're saying something that makes it feel worse? Taking a deep breath makes it feel pretty bad.","OK, and. I'm just going to circle back to this chest pain. You said you feel it on the right side. Is it always there or is it just when you take a deep breath or is it kind of on and off?"
It's kind of always there. It gets a little bit worse with coughing and when I take a pretty big deep breath.,"Yeah, OK, but if you were just laying down, not coughing, is that pain there?"
"Yeah yeah, specially notice over the last day,",OK.

"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.",Can you tell me about what brought you in today?

"No. I've been pretty healthy otherwise. I've never had like I've never had like a dry cough like this. I've had runny nose in the past, but they never lasted this long.","OK, have you ever been in the hospital?"
No.,OK. Did you see your family doctor for anything? Any health problems?
"No, no.",Do you take any medicines?
No.,"OK. This may be a tricky one to answer, so Mom can definitely help us. Do you have any family history of respiratory problems?"

I have a four year old sister.,"OK, do you live with your dad too?"
Yes.,Do you guys have any pets?
"Um no, no pets.",And does anyone smoke in the home?
"Nope, no.","OK, and what do you like to do for fun?"
"Um I like playing with my friends, I like playing video games.",Oh cool. So what's your favorite game?
I am playing Rollercoaster Tycoon.,"Oh cool, that sounds like fun. OK well, hopefully we can get you back to feeling healthy so you can continue to play lots of roller coaster Tycoon. So I’m going to go get the doctor that I'm working with. I'm, uh, I'm wondering, you know, he might want to do a chest X Ray and get a better look at what's going on there. Have you ever had an X Ray before?"
"I don't think so, no.",Do you know what an X Ray is?
"A little bit, yeah.","Yeah it's like taking picture of your body on the inside. It's pretty cool so it gives us an idea of what's going on in the inside. Also, this really this part is kind of not so much fun, but I think we should probably do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately and that's not a lot of fun. We gotta stick something up your nose, but I think that you're really brave and I think that you'll be just fine with it, OK?"
OK.,So we're going to arrange for these things and then I will come back with the doctor that I'm working with and we'll kind of talk about where to go from here.
"OK, that sounds good.",Thank you guys for chatting with me.
"Yeah, thank you.",Thanks.

"No. I mean, I'm I'm tired, but I don't think they're not like hurting.","OK, so aside that aside from kind of this dry cough feeling hot that otherwise you're feeling OK. You don't have any other real concerns aside from that."
"Yeah, just like I just feel crappy like. Yeah, I really. I don't think I know that's not like a a real like way to say.","Oh no, no, it's perfectly valid. We called that Malays in general. Just feeling a little bit off. Alright so this is going to talk about you for a little bit, but first, we'll get to that later. So any issues that you've seen a doctor for before?"
I have I have allergies. Usually in like the spring in the fall.,Do you have any allergies to any medications?
"No, no nothing like that. It's just like I get, really bad allergies like I I've seen an allergist and some years I've gotten allergy shots. But like not every year. Otherwise, I'll take like Claritin. This isn't like this is maybe around like this is just before they normally start, so I don't really have them right now.",OK.
Probably like in a few weeks they'd be really bad.,Now do any of these allergies can't make it difficult to breathe or you feel like your face is swelling up?
Uh. Like it feels like a little bit like plugged up an like what's that called like post nasal drip? But I don't really feel like I can't breathe.,It's just like a little stuffy.
"Yeah, yeah, exactly.","And these shots at the allergist gave you, how often would you get those?"
"Those are the ones that I'd have like once. Usually like once a week for a little while, like in the winter before.","OK, so you don't carry an EpiPen with you."
"No, no, they said it's not like one of those allergies and it's just like it's just like the seasonal ones. But they're just bad.","OK, sounds good. So you've seen an allergist. Any other doctors that you've seen in your life?"
My family doctor. I don’t really go very often.,"OK, has there been any health issues that you've had in the past?"

Yeah.,"OK good, do you live with them right now?"
"Yeah, yeah, like I'm in high school.",OK so you live in a house with both your parents. OK any brothers sisters?

But like we are doing our school from home now so.,Got it.
My mom works from home and my dad just works like on the farm so. So no one's been like seeing anyone or going anywhere to get sick.,"OK, so sorry, do you live on a farm?"
"Yeah,","OK, in London?"
Like just outside.,OK. Any travel or anywhere recently?
"No, like I just just came here. But like I don't really leave the house",So last last two weeks you haven't left the country?

"Like I tried marijuana once at a party like a couple years ago, but like I had, I never did it again.","Got it so none of the harder drugs, cocaine, heroin?"
No.,And I gotta ask this question for everyone. Have you ever injected drugs or anything into your arm or your body?
No.,"OK. Alright, thanks Jessica. So just to summarize, you kind of had a three to four day dry cough with a little bit of fever, some headache, and just in terms was quickly reviewing then. So you have been bringing anything up. No one in contact with these recently been sick. You don't have asthma, your not taking any medications aside from Claritin, and your little brother might have been sick about two weeks ago with kind of a common cold and we're hoping to get out of this visit is just kind of next steps and where to go from here, correct?"
"Yeah, like, I just want to know if I have to like take medicine or something.",OK. Alright perfect Thank you very much. You have any more questions?
"No, I don't know. I don't have any more questions. I just like I can go home soon like lay down.","Sounds good, thanks Jessica."
I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in.,"Yeah, so like a couple months ago I was in the office and they told me that I have asthma like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it, but apparently not, or like it came back or something so. Yeah, so they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues."
"OK, So what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago?",Uh. So like I have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like I'm looking good athlete but I just couldn't go much faster and I was like saying I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know my mom was like you should probably go. We should probably make an appointment.
"OK, and uh, when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing?","Yeah, yeah, like I will if I if I try to run fast. Like I, kinda can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower."
"OK, and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away?","If I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it, I I don't know not very long like couple of minutes."
"OK, and uh, does this happen in any other settings?","Oh, like sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like it. My chest feels tight and just feel like I can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow Angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, another time, like I went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats I I felt like I got wheezy sound and I felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like I had to leave."
"OK, so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds? Like you've had noisy breathing before?","Yeah, mostly just with the cat."
OK.,"We don't have a cat at my house, so I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and. Then at that time, I could actually hear it."
"OK, and have you had a cough?","Uh, no, I don't think so."
"OK, And. Were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away?","Like I have the, uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So yeah, like I've been using it in gym class now."
"OK, how many days per week are you using that?","Well, I'm a little confused now because. I the 1 supposed to use, like every day a couple times, and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both, so I only got the one at the pharmacy so I don't really I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now, but I always use the 1 supposed to be like 2 times a day, the one that starts with an ""s"", um but sometimes I just do it once a day if I forget the second one."
"OK, well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes, for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit, and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time?","Oh no. No, mostly like gym class like I said."
OK. And have you had any other associated symptoms?,Uh. I don't think so. Like what do you mean?
"Um, so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing?","When I was around the cats, yeah. But not the other times."
OK. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin?,When I was a kid but not really now.
"OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?",No.
OK. Any infectious symptoms overall?,"Ahh, I don't I don't think so."
"OK, any urinary problems?","Uh, like. No, no."
OK. Bowel problems?,"uh no, no. No, that's all good."
"OK um. And, uh, any fevers or chills?",No.
"OK, and then how about, uh, have you been having any night sweats?",What's that?
"So, uh, overnight when you're sleeping you wake up with either your like pajamas drenched, or your your sheets drenched drenched from sweating.",Oh no.
OK.,Um not that.
"OK. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?","No, no that's it."
"OK, um, and any recent hospitalizations?",Like I broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast.
"OK, and any surgeries?",Uh. Just like my wisdom teeth.
"OK, and any medications besides it like that, including the inhalers?","Nothing else, just. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin."
"OK, and any allergies?","What I don't know like not that I thought, but maybe like cats."
"OK, and do you have any like seasonal allergies? Do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy",
"Hi, I'm Rob and I just feel like I can't catch my breath.","OK, how old are you Rob?"
I'm I'm 50 I'm gonna be 50 soon.,"OK, OK, when did this start?"
"Well, like last night I kinda had like an ache on my chest, kind of like here like on the left. I just I didn't do anything really last night and you know I just went to sleep and I got to sleep fine like I just thought maybe I pulled a muscle on this side. But then I woke up and I was like walking up the stairs and I like was kinda having a hard time breathing and I took some Tylenol. It didn't really do anything. Um, and then it just got worse and then a few hours ago is like I could barely walk. And if I'm breathing deep it's like it just hurts. And I feel like I can't like catch my breath like I can't get a good like a good breath in.","Um, OK, so I just want to state at this point I would do ABC's, like I would do the vitals and make sure you're stable and then do airway breathing circulation if you weren't before I continue with the history. OK, so. OK, so that's how it started. Um, are you having any chest pain at all associated with that?"
"Like when I breathe in, I get like and it's like an ache. And then if I breathe really deep it feels like a little sharp.",OK.
I have never had anything like this before.,"No? OK, that was going to be my next question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your shortness of breath, 10 being the worst?"
"Um, I don't, I don't know, um. Like I can breathe right now, I can't get like a deep breath, like...","Does it? Oh sorry, go ahead."
Maybe like you know five or six.,"OK, OK. Does it hurt when you take a deep breath in?"
Yeah.,Yeah?
"Yeah, it's like it's like sharp.","OK, sorry, sounds like you're having some pleuritic chest pain. Do you have any coughing associated with that?"
No no.,No? You're not coughing up any blood?
No.,Any swelling in your legs?
I I don't think so.,"No? OK, how about on exertion? Like when you walk or run, or you know, does it hurt more or does I mean sorry, does your shortness of breath get worse?"
"Oh yeah, it was like going up the stairs, can't really breathe in after.","OK, how about when you're laying down?"
"I don't know. I don't think that's any different. No, I slept fine last night. I got up and when I went up the stairs I was like holy...",OK. How about wheezing? Are you experiencing any wheezing?

I don't know.,"No? OK. And you said this has never happened to you before, right?"
"Right, yeah.",Does it get better with you sitting forward?
"I don't know, like I, I feel like that it's still kind of aching like it doesn't, it's not really like changing very much.","OK. OK. OK, any changes in your vision, hearing or smell?"
No.,No? Any rashes?
No.,No? Weight loss?
"I, I mean, I've been trying to to lose weight.",OK.

So I've lost like 15 pounds but like not... Like I've been trying to.,"OK, OK. 15 pounds, that's good. Are you experiencing any dizziness or you feeling faint?"
"No, just like a I can't get like a good breath.","OK, and are you otherwise healthy? You mentioned you have high blood pressure, anything else?"
"No, that's that's like it. I've never had any like chest problems.","OK. Have you had any investigations done for your chest like pulmonary function tests, ECG's, chest X-rays?"
"No, no, they just they just put the thing on my arm. But my doctors office and said that it was high. So they said to you know, eat better and I don't I don't wanna start any drugs so, I didn't do anything. I've been fine ever since.","OK, so you're not on any medications?"

"OK, alright good, um so now we're just going to move on to the physical exam part um of this interview. Um so I'm going to get you to look at both your arms, hands, and wrists, um side by side. Does your left one seem at all more red, swollen, uh or hot.","No, no symptoms like that."
"No, OK. And um do you, does that one seem to be more atrophied or are there any deformities or skin changes on that one?","Um maybe uh a little less muscle bulk on the, like where my thumb is."
"OK, OK. Um and then I'm gonna get you to palpate certain areas of that arm. So let's start um at the top, when you when you press down on your shoulder blades or just at the very top of your um arm where your, or at the very top where your arm connects to your shoulder, does it hurt over there?","No, no pain there."
OK. So no pain on the acromion process or the scapula. Um any pain where your biceps are?,No.
"No, OK. How about at your elbows?","Uh no pain at the elbows and full, I can move my elbows and shoulders, uh no problem either. And my neck doesn't hurt at all either, I can move my neck around."
"How about when you um palpate your wrists, both sides, medial and lateral?","Uh, yeah no, no pain if I'm just pressing or palpating the wrist."
"OK. Um and I'm going to get you to um straighten out your arm and flex at your shoulder and extend at your shoulder, does that hurt?",No.
How about when you flex your elbow and extend your elbow?,No.
Um how about when you flex your wrist and extend your wrist?,No.
"OK, so I'm going to do a special test for something called carpal tunnel syndrome. Um so um I'm gonna get you to straighten out your left arm again um and right where um alright, how do we do this? OK, so with your right hand or with your yeah, with your right index finger and middle finger, you're going to tap um just below uh where the bulk of your thumb muscles are um connecting to your wrist. I'm just going to get you to tap that area. Do you feel tingling like an electric shock sensation in your hand or anything like that.","I do, yeah."
"You do, OK, so that's a positive Tinel's sign. Um and then we're going to do one more test, so I'm going to, OK so make like a prayer motion with your hands like um putting your 2 palms together and then um and then instead invert your hand so that the outer parts are touching and your fingers are pointing towards the ground.",OK.
"So kind of like upside down but with your outer parts of your hands touching. Um and then I'm going to get you to uh just hold your arms like that um for about 60 seconds. Do you feel any tingling, numbness, or pain in those fingers?","Yeah, I get a bit of uh numbness and tingling when when I do that."
"OK, so that's a positive Phalen's sign test. Um alright, so that brings me to the end of um this interview, did you have any questions or concerns, anything that you wanted to bring up?",Uh just wondering about um what this could be.
"Oh yeah, so um it seems like you have something called carpal tunnel syndrome. Um and that is, it's pretty common um so it can be caused by um a lot of things, but basically your median nerve runs through your forearm into your wrist, and anything that squeezes or irritates that median nerve can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, um and some things include um like repetitive movements at work, um obesity, um any nerve damaging conditions like diabetes, um inflammatory conditions, but mostly just like workplace factors can can do it, um especially if you're working with like vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires like repetitive and prolonged flexing of the wrist. Um so uh diagnosis, we just do that through like symptoms, physical exam, um we don't really need to do any imaging at this at this point. And to treat it um basically work modification, so taking frequent breaks, uh not doing those repetitive movements um as often um and then you can do things at home, like apply cold packs. Um and then we also have some like non-surgical treatments where we can uh splint, we can put like a wrist splint um while you sleep to relieve those nighttime symptoms. Uh you can take some NSAIDs to relieve pain, um and if those don't work, we can try corticosteroids, um and if that doesn't work, then we can also discuss surgery sometime down the line. Does that sound OK?","It does, yeah, thank you."
How may I help you?,"I'm I'm here because I, I've oddly been feeling really short of breath and have a fever or and a cough."
"OK, when did the shortness of breath start and are you short of breath now?","It started about uh, I guess I could start yesterday. And a little bit, but it's getting better."

"OK. OK, well I think those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions for myself?",I don't think so. I just I hope you know we can get this figured out.
"Yeah, for sure. So we'll start with doing a Covid swab because you have some symptoms that overlap with it, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. But it does sound like what you're telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath, I think it's worthwhile to get a chest x-ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia, and if you do, if there is some consolidation we'll probably prescribe some antibiotics for that. Umm, how does that sound to you?","Sounds great to me. Yeah, I just you know, hope there's nothing serious going on."
"Yeah, yeah, and it shouldn't be. It's probably 1 something that's been going around in the community and you haven't had any recent hospitalizations or surgery, so I wouldn't worry about like any of those atypical bugs just yet.","OK, OK, that's good to hear."
"Yeah, for sure. Well, uhm, thank you.","OK, thank you."

It takes a few weeks for the symptoms to get relieved, but there's not much that we can do besides supportive care, so make sure you get you stay well hydrated. You can use over the counter medications uh like Tylenol cold. now, if you to relieve some of your symptoms, but since right now we're in a pandemic, some of these symptoms can also be seen in covid patients, so we will also get a swab done for you today, and you should have the results back by 48 hours. Um until then, we recommend that you stay isolated in your own home and not see anyone else. And then once the results come back, you'll get further instructions from public health."
"OK, that sounds great. Thank you.",Your welcome. Take care
