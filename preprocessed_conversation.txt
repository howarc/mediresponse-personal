We've stabilized their vitals for now. <|endoftext|> Oh thank god... Is the worst over?
We're still monitoring them closely. <|endoftext|> So they could still...?
There's always a risk, but we're doing everything we can. <|endoftext|> I can't lose them, doctor. They're my whole world.
I understand. We'll keep you updated. <|endoftext|> Please, just tell me they'll be okay.
We're hopeful, but it's too early to say for sure. <|endoftext|> I don't know if I can handle this...
We're here for you. You're not alone in this. <|endoftext|> Thank you... I just... I need a moment.
Take all the time you need. <|endoftext|> I just want them to wake up.
The surgery was a success. <|endoftext|> Really? Oh, that's wonderful news!
They're still in recovery, but the initial signs are positive. <|endoftext|> Can I see them?
Not yet, but soon. They need to rest. <|endoftext|> Okay... as long as they're okay.
We'll let you know when you can visit. <|endoftext|> Thank you so much, doctor.
We're doing everything we can for them. <|endoftext|> I know you are. I appreciate it.
We'll keep you updated on their progress. <|endoftext|> Thank you. Thank you for everything.
There were some complications during the procedure. <|endoftext|> Complications? What do you mean?
We had to address an unexpected issue, but we managed it. <|endoftext|> Is that why it's taking so long?
"Yes, but they're out of surgery now. <|endoftext|>  ""But are they okay? What happened?"""
They're stable for now, but we need to monitor them closely. <|endoftext|> This is all my fault... I shouldn't have...
This isn't your fault. We're focusing on their recovery. <|endoftext|> I just want them to be okay...
We all do. We'll keep you informed. <|endoftext|> Please... just save them.
I'm afraid I have some bad news. <|endoftext|> What? What is it?
Their condition has worsened. <|endoftext|> No... No, this can't be happening.
We're doing everything we can, but... <|endoftext|> But what? Tell me!
They're not responding to treatment as we hoped. <|endoftext|> No... Please, you have to do something!
We're consulting with other specialists. <|endoftext|> They can't... They can't leave me...
We're doing everything in our power. <|endoftext|> I don't know what I'll do if...
We need to discuss their care plan going forward. <|endoftext|> Care plan? What do you mean?
Given their condition, we need to consider all options. <|endoftext|> Options? What options?
We may need to make some difficult decisions. <|endoftext|> Difficult decisions? Like what?
We may need to consider palliative care. <|endoftext|> Palliative care? Are you saying...?
We want to ensure they're comfortable. <|endoftext|> No... There has to be something else...
We'll discuss all possibilities with you. <|endoftext|> I... I need some time to think.
