We live in a house just in London, and like, I made sure to just isolate myself to one room and I wear a mask around them just in case.\nOK. Have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?\nNot the loss of taste and smell, but like the other stuff when I just had a cold or flu like symptoms previously, but the taste and smell is something completely new.\nOK good. That's good. So those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we ended the interview?\nWell, I'm just hoping to to get this sorted out and feel better.\nOK, so it has been more difficult to breathe. And is that is that at rest as well, do you feel that kind of sensation?\nYeah, even right now, just a little bit, like it's it's not anything that I'm too worried about, but it is there.\nOK, and, so how long has it been going on for then if it started last night?\nSo I guess it would be a couple of hours now, maybe like 8.\nYeah, hopefully it's not, um but if it is, it's it's OK, like um we'll get infectious disease involved. Uh we'll get the isolation going and we'll get you on the correct treatment.\nOK, thank you so much.\nOK, how about changes to your bowel movements?\nNo, I don't think so. I go regularly once a day and I haven't noticed any watery stool or diarrhea.\nOK, and when did you start feeling nauseous?\nIt kinda comes and goes, I've had that problem for the last two months or so.\nOK, and how about, um, any weight loss over the past few months?\nNo, it's been been stable.\nOK, OK. Um so it was a vaginal delivery, but they used some tools like forceps maybe or vacuum?\nYeah, yeah it was forceps, yeah.\nOK, sure. Any rashes?\nNo.\nOK, but you've been having chills and are you having any other symptoms?\nYeah, chills. I've been feeling kind of hot during the day.\nOK, and you said you didn't have a cough or a sore throat, but have you had any wheezing?\nNo wheezing.\nOK, uhm, alright, so that was all of the questions that I wanted to ask today. So the next part we'll go on to do a physical exam, but did you have any thing else that maybe I forgot to ask about today?\nUh, no, I, I, I think I know what this was caused by, but yeah, let's, let's see. Thanks for your help.\nOK so you have, you said you have been previously healthy, nothing that you've been seeing your family doctor for on a regular basis. Do you take any medications?\nUhm, I do not, no medications, just the Tylenol and Advil I tried for the pain.\nOK, yeah, we'll do like a full physical examination as well. And we'll get like your oxygenation level and everything like that. Umm, do you have any, besides COPD, so when were you diagnosed with you please?\nAbout 10 years ago.\nSure, OK. No surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?\nNo.\nOK, have you had any recent infections like a cold?\nNo.\nAlright, and uh, have you had any surgeries in the past?\nNo.\nHow about dizziness or fainting spells?\nUmm, a little bit dizzy I when I got out of bed this morning, but we sat back down for a couple of minutes. I felt better.\nOK. Any fevers or chills?\nYeah, I have had, I've had both of those. I've had a I I checked my temperature this morning and it was 38.2 and I was pretty chilly last night.\nYeah, for sure. What started first?\nI would say the there was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise, and he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that.\nUh, smell or taste?\nNo.\nOK, and has he been around anyone who's been sick?  Maybe at his daycare?\nI, I mean, his sister has had had some colds. She's also in his daycare. So I mean, maybe her.\nYeah, um so it sounds um right now like you may have some sort of uh sacral nerve radiculopathy um or or like a lower lumbar, lumbar um radiculopathy, um basically uh that's known as sciatica, uh where your nerve roots can be compressed, causing some of these symptoms. Um and to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam um but if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including um numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder incontinence, then we can look at some um imaging for the for the spine, including MRI. Um and so in terms of management of this, um we can try a couple couple of like conservative approaches first, so that includes taking NSAIDs uh for the pain um and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down um all the time, um perhaps like taking little breaks, uh stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well um during those breaks can help um, and as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy and they'll do some exercises with you and um slowly increase those exercises. Um and if those still don't work, we can try um steroids, steroid injections, um as well, we talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about 6 to 8 weeks. Does that sound OK?\nYeah, that sounds good. Thank you.\nI even got the coronavirus vaccine.\nOK, good Congrats. Did you also get the shingles vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine?\nOK. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?\nUm yeah, so I've been diagnosed with diabetes. Hypertension. Hypercholesterolemia. Obesity. And and I think, yeah, I think that's that's about it.\nOK, and does the joint feel like it's hot?\nNo.\nAnd any allergies to medications or, uh, environmental?\nNo.\nOK and uhm, if you wanted to talk about quitting, we can discuss that further at a later time if you'd like. Uhm, and so do you use any recreational drugs?\nNo, no no no drugs at all.\nHow much did you smoke back then?\nProbably half a pack a day.\nOK, and do you notice any like bony pieces that are pushing on the skin?\nNo.\nOK, OK, so I'm just going to ask you questions about specifically to examine your wrist so you notice. So can you. Are you able to move your wrist around? Are you able to make a fist?\nI I can but it I can't really bad my thumb and it it it hurts a lot. So I can bend my fingers but my thumb is kinda out.\nOK, alright um immunizations wise, are you up to date?\nUh I I am, yes.\nOK, and how about alcohol?\nUh rarely I'll have maybe a glass of wine like once every couple of months, but it's pretty infrequent.\nSo they have similar symptoms to you as well then?\nYeah, some of them like don't really have the shortness of breath and it's just like a cough.\nOK, uhm, so I'm gonna try a special test, it's called the Ober test. So can I get you to lie on the side um with the injured knee?\nYep.\nTwo days ago.\nAnd is the cough been, um producing any phlegm or sputum?\nA runny nose as well? OK, when did that start?\nUhm, maybe like I don't know just now even, like an hour or two ago.\nOK and have you had any similar episodes before?\nI've never brought up blood before.\nUm, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show\nSounds good.\nOK, anybody in the family have cancer?\nMy mom, my mom had breast cancer.\nOK, and regarding other, any, we already talked about chest pain, uh you've been able to eat food alright?\nUh yeah, like uh yeah it's like pretty normal.\nNo, I haven't had any diarrhea or any any any constipation nothing like that.\nOK, any nausea vomiting?\nOK, and where exactly is uh is the back pain?\nSo the pain's just right in the in the lower back.\nOK. Alright, so yeah those are all the questions I had for you today. Um, do you have any other questions for me?\nUhm, nope, that was it.\nA green green supplement?\nYeah, it's just sort of like a like a green um powder. It's supposed to replace uh I don't know one of your servings of vegetables for the day.\nNothing to concerning? No drug allergies?\nNo, nothing like that.\nYeah, I've tried some Tylenol and Advil, and that the Advil is actually helped taking the edge off a little bit, but the next morning I I have the stiffness and and pain again.\nOk, and for your pain, are there any kind of factors that make the pain worse, like bending down or standing straight up or laying down anything that makes your pain worse?\nOK, so no numbness in the groin area, no weakness, no um changes in your bowel or bladder habits, including no incontinence, so uh no red flags?\nYeah, nothing like that.\nAlright, and you use any recreational drugs like cocaine, crystal meth, or IV drugs.\nNo, nothing like that.\nI honestly I felt hot like all the time like yeah yeah night. I feel hot but during the day too I'm just like I'm I'm like hey I'm wearing like just shorts and like a tank top and I just still feel really hot.\nOK. You notice, skin changes anything in your arms or legs it looks weird? New rashes?\nNo.\nNo? Any rashes?\nOK, any allergies to medications you're aware of or or environmental things like or dust or pollen?\nNo no. Which is why I was kind of surprised. I'm usually fine and I spend a lot of time outdoors so, I don't know. Yeah, I was surprised when this happened when I went to his place.\nOh no.\nNo. And you drink alcohol?
