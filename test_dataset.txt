We're doing everything we can. <|endoftext|> ...
We'll be here to support you every step of the way. <|endoftext|> I just... need a moment.
We're cautiously optimistic. We'll continue to monitor him closely. <|endoftext|> I can't wait to talk to him again...
They're gone. <|endoftext|> No... No, this can't be happening.
We're confident this is the best course of action. <|endoftext|> I trust your judgment, doctor.
We understand. We'll keep you informed of his progress every step of the way. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
He's resting comfortably now, you can see him in a few hours. <|endoftext|> Thank you, doctor.
This could be a life-saver. <|endoftext|> You've given us hope.
We're doing everything we can to ease their discomfort. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
We'll still need to monitor it, but it's not a cause for immediate concern. <|endoftext|> I can't believe it... Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much!
Not yet, but soon. They need to rest. <|endoftext|> Okay... as long as they're okay.
It's a rare condition, but we have a treatment plan in place. <|endoftext|> Rare? How rare? Is it treatable?
We'll keep you updated on his progress and discuss the next steps soon. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
We did everything we could. <|endoftext|> This can't be happening.
We'll be here to guide you through every step of the process. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
We're doing everything we can. He's a fighter. <|endoftext|> He has to be okay. He promised to walk me down the aisle next year.
She's a very lucky woman. You were here for her throughout all of this. <|endoftext|> I'll always be here for her.
We'll discuss all possibilities with you. <|endoftext|> I... I need some time to think.
We could try a different medication or explore alternative pain management techniques. <|endoftext|> I just want her to be comfortable.
We'll discuss discharge plans when he's a bit stronger. <|endoftext|> I can't wait for that day.
I understand this is difficult, but we need to be thorough. <|endoftext|> Just tell me the truth, doctor. Is it bad?
We don't have all the answers yet. We're doing our best. <|endoftext|> I just... I don't know what I'll do if...
He's a fighter, and we're doing everything we can to support him. We'll know more in the next 24 hours. <|endoftext|> I just... I can't lose him.
I'm afraid I don't have good news. The tests revealed a large mass... <|endoftext|> What kind of mass? Is it... is it cancer?
We're here for you both. <|endoftext|> I don't want to lose them.
Her vitals are stable. <|endoftext|> Thank goodness.
She's still very weak, but this is a step in the right direction. <|endoftext|> I'm so happy...
You being here for him is the best thing you can do. <|endoftext|> I'll stay by his side no matter what.
We need to discuss their medication. <|endoftext|> Is something wrong?
He's still unconscious, but his brain activity is showing positive signs. <|endoftext|> Does that mean he'll wake up soon?
Of course. He'll be happy to see you. <|endoftext|> I've been waiting for this moment...
He's still in recovery, but the initial signs are positive. <|endoftext|> Can I see him?
She has a long road ahead, but we're hopeful. <|endoftext|> I'll be by her side every step of the way.
Their condition has worsened overnight. <|endoftext|> No... No, this can't be happening.
There's always a risk, but we're doing everything we can. <|endoftext|> I can't lose them, doctor. They're my whole world.
We're just doing our job. We'll keep you updated on her progress. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
Of course. We'll continue to monitor him closely and keep you updated. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
We need to discuss end-of-life care. <|endoftext|> End-of-life? But...
Talk to them. Let them know you're here. <|endoftext|> I will.
They may not be awake, but they can hear you. <|endoftext|> I'll stay by their side.
We have a skilled surgical team, and we'll do everything we can to ensure a successful outcome. <|endoftext|> I'm so scared...
The results are inconclusive. <|endoftext|> What does that mean?
He's a fighter, and he has you. That's a powerful combination. <|endoftext|> I just want him to wake up.
We'll keep you updated on their progress. <|endoftext|> I can't wait to see them.
They seem to be doing a little better today. <|endoftext|> That's such a relief to hear.
We understand. <|endoftext|> This isn't fair.
We've stabilized their vitals for now. <|endoftext|> Oh thank god... Is the worst over?
We're doing everything we can for them. <|endoftext|> I know you are. I appreciate it.
He's still in critical condition. We're doing everything we can to stabilize him. <|endoftext|> He can't die...
They're not responding to treatment as we hoped. <|endoftext|> No... Please, you have to do something!
We understand this is difficult. <|endoftext|> I can't say goodbye.
They're out of surgery now. <|endoftext|> Thank goodness! How did it go?
There's always a slight risk, but it's necessary. <|endoftext|> I understand.
He's been asking for you. <|endoftext|> I'll go see him right away.
We've identified the cause of their symptoms. <|endoftext|> What is it? What's wrong with them?
We're here for you both. <|endoftext|> Thank you for everything.
We can discuss options for home care. <|endoftext|> I don't know if I can handle that.
We all do. We'll keep you informed. <|endoftext|> Please... just save them.
We'll see how he progresses in the next few days. <|endoftext|> Thank you for everything, doctor.
They're asking for you again. <|endoftext|> I'm coming.
She's still a bit groggy from the anesthesia, but you can see her soon. <|endoftext|> I was so worried... I can't wait to tell her it's all okay.
It's hard. <|endoftext|> I understand.
It's a potentially life-threatening condition. We're doing everything we can to control the infection. <|endoftext|> Is she going to be okay?
He's still in the ICU, but you'll be able to see him soon. <|endoftext|> Can you tell him I'm here? That I love him?
They seem to be at peace. <|endoftext|> I'm glad.
We won't know until we get the results back. <|endoftext|> I'm so scared.
We can't say for sure. It could be days, or even weeks. <|endoftext|> I just want to hear her voice again.
We'll explain everything in detail. <|endoftext|> Will they be okay?
We'll need to run further tests to determine his neurological status. <|endoftext|> This is a nightmare...
His blood pressure is still a bit high, but the medication is working. <|endoftext|> Will he need surgery?
The test results are back, and I'm afraid it's not good news. <|endoftext|> ...What is it?
Of course. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
He's still in recovery, and there's a risk of complications, but we're cautiously optimistic. <|endoftext|> Complications? Like what?
She's resting comfortably now. The pain medication seems to be working. <|endoftext|> That's good to hear.
We understand. We'll discuss all the options with you and find the best solution for her. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
I'm afraid there's nothing more we can do. The cancer is too aggressive. <|endoftext|> ...What do you mean?
We've identified the bacteria causing the infection, and we've started her on a course of strong antibiotics. <|endoftext|> Is she going to be okay?
It's important they rest. <|endoftext|> I just want them to wake up.
We all do. We're doing our best, and we'll keep you informed of any changes. <|endoftext|> Thank you, doctor. For everything.
She's still groggy from the anesthesia, but you can see her shortly. <|endoftext|> I was so worried...
Just stay strong. <|endoftext|> I don't know if I can.
I'm so sorry. <|endoftext|> No... no...
We were able to repair the fracture, and the surgery went well. <|endoftext|> That's a relief...
I'm afraid I have some bad news. <|endoftext|> What? What is it?
Just remember, he's still recovering. Keep the visit short and let him rest. <|endoftext|> Of course. Thank you so much!
We've scheduled the surgery for tomorrow morning. <|endoftext|> Is there anything we need to do to prepare?
We may need to consider palliative care. <|endoftext|> Palliative care? Are you saying...?
There's been some improvement. <|endoftext|> Really? That's wonderful news!
We all do. <|endoftext|> If only I spent more time with her..
He's asking for you. <|endoftext|> Really? Can I go see him now?
The cancer is quite advanced. We'll explore all options for his comfort and quality of life. <|endoftext|> But... how much time does he have?
We're doing everything we can right now. Your mother is a fighter. <|endoftext|> Will she be okay? Is she going to make it?
There was some bleeding, but we were able to control it. <|endoftext|> Is she going to be okay?
We're doing our best, but her condition is critical. <|endoftext|> I can't lose her...
She's a fighter. <|endoftext|> She is. She's the strongest person I know.
There's been some internal bleeding, but we're addressing it. <|endoftext|> Is she going to be okay? Is she in pain?
We have a chaplain available if you need someone to talk to. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
It's hard to say for sure. <|endoftext|> Please... just tell me.
It's understandable to feel this way. <|endoftext|> Thank you Doctor.
Yes, but they're out of surgery now. <|endoftext|> But are they okay? What happened?
We all do. We're here for you both. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
We all do. <|endoftext|> I appreciate you saying that.
I'm afraid I have some bad news. <|endoftext|> What? What is it?
The infection is spreading, and we're concerned about sepsis. <|endoftext|> Sepsis? Is that serious?
We're doing everything we can to ensure that she recovers fully. <|endoftext|> I can't thank you enough.
We need to have a serious discussion. <|endoftext|> What is it, doctor?
She suffered a stroke. We're doing everything we can to manage her symptoms. <|endoftext|> Will she recover? Will she be able to talk? Walk?
We'll monitor his progress and determine when it's safe for him to go home. <|endoftext|> I just want him to be okay.
We're cautiously optimistic, but she's not out of the woods yet. <|endoftext|> Is she going to be okay?
We'll monitor them closely. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
We're seeing some cognitive decline. <|endoftext|> Decline? What does that mean?
He even managed to walk a little with assistance. <|endoftext|> I'm so proud of him!
It's a good sign, but it's hard to say when he'll regain consciousness. <|endoftext|> I just want to hear his voice again...
We need to discuss their care plan going forward. <|endoftext|> Care plan? What do you mean?
It means we need to discuss further treatment options. <|endoftext|> Is he going to...?
It appears to be a complication from her previous condition. We're still running tests. <|endoftext|> I don't understand... how could this happen?
We're doing everything we can to minimize any potential damage. We have a neurology team monitoring him closely. <|endoftext|> He's just a kid... this isn't fair.
We were able to stop the internal bleeding, but his blood pressure is still low. <|endoftext|> Is he going to make it?
They're asking for you. <|endoftext|> I'll be right there.
We've identified the issue. <|endoftext|> What is it? What's wrong?
We all do. We have a dedicated team providing her with the best possible care. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
We're consulting with other specialists, exploring all options. <|endoftext|> They can't... They can't leave me...
Absolutely. He'll be thrilled to see you. <|endoftext|> I can't wait!
We're here with you. <|endoftext|> They can't leave me.
It could potentially speed up the recovery process. <|endoftext|> I'm willing to try anything.
...Yes, it appears to be malignant. <|endoftext|> Oh god...
He's determined to get better. <|endoftext|> That's my dad.
We need to talk about their prognosis. <|endoftext|> Prognosis? What do you mean?
It's not what we were hoping for. <|endoftext|> What does that mean?
We understand. We'll keep you informed of any changes. <|endoftext|> Thank you.
They're asking for you. <|endoftext|> Really? Oh, I need to see them!
They're having trouble breathing. <|endoftext|> What's happening?
The surgery was more complicated than we anticipated, but we were able to remove the tumor completely. <|endoftext|> Is he going to be okay?
We'll give you some privacy. <|endoftext|> Thank you, doctor.
They've developed an infection. <|endoftext|> An infection? How did that happen?
We've exhausted all our options. <|endoftext|> What are you saying?
We need to run additional tests to get a clearer picture. <|endoftext|> Is it serious? Is it... something bad?
We're doing everything in our power. <|endoftext|> I don't know what I'll do if...
This isn't your fault. We're focusing on their recovery. <|endoftext|> I just want them to be okay...
The treatment is working, but it's a difficult process. <|endoftext|> She's so strong...
Their pain is being managed. <|endoftext|> Are they in a lot of pain?
They may not be awake, but they can hear you. <|endoftext|> I'll stay by their side.
This is not your fault. Don't blame yourself. <|endoftext|> How can I not? I should have taken better care of him.
We need to run some additional tests. <|endoftext|> Is it something serious?
He's responding well to the treatment. His white blood cell count is improving. <|endoftext|> Does that mean he's getting better?
We hope so. We're doing everything we can. <|endoftext|> I'm so worried.
We're consulting with other specialists. <|endoftext|> They can't... They can't leave me...
We understand this is a difficult time. We'll keep you updated on his condition. <|endoftext|> I just want him to pull through...
We'll do everything we can to give him the best quality of life for as long as possible. <|endoftext|> I... I can't... this can't be happening.
I know this is difficult, but we're doing everything we can. <|endoftext|> I just want her to wake up.
We're here for you. You're not alone in this. <|endoftext|> Thank you... I just... I need a moment.
