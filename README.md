The hardest part of being in the medical field is different for everyone. Whether it is getting into med school or going through residency, it is a difficult endeavor. However, we argue that the part that weighs the most on you, is speaking to a worried relative or friend.


Mediresponse is not a medical chatbot that tells you what pneumonia is or gives possible treatments to the cold. It is a relative or friend that you must face. 


Whether the diagnosis came up positive or not, it is up to you to deliver the news in a way that soothes their nerves, no matter the outcome.
